Extracted by H. E Milliron. A Monograph of the Western Hemisphere Bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae; Bombinae) II. The Genus Megabombus Subgenus Megabombus. The Entomological Society of Canada, Ottawa 1970. pp. 239-330. <p> 
Description. Queen. Length, 20.0 mm; width at wing bases, 10.0 mm; abdomen, 10.0 mm, width across T2, 9.5 mm; front wing length, 18.0 mm, width, 6.0 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, as wide as its median height, the temples broadly and evenly rounded, weakly arcuate across the vertex; vertical region weakly unevenly concave, for the most part covered with small (follicular) punctures, moderately inclined toward the occiput; ocular half of ocellocular area with only a few irregular punctures, the ocellar half smooth; compound eyes noticeably more broadly and evenly rounded below than above, their subparallel inner margins being weakly incurved and only slightly divergent below; ocelli of medium size, located much closer together than their diameters in a very weak arc noticeably below the supraorbital line; interocellar line about equal to the ocellocular line; malar space about equal to distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, unevenly weakly convex and with relatively few mostly small punctures; labrum moderately pubescent, nearly 2\ times wider than thick, its ventral margin mostly arcuate, the shelf not sharp and only moderately prominent, the tubercles flat below and rather coarsely punctate above with their mesal summits well separated by a somewhat deep intertubercular depression that is about as wide as the length of FI; flagellum If times longer than scape, FI about equal to If times the length of F2 and about £ the combined lengths of F2 and F3, the latter considerably longer than the short rectangular F2; clypeus little wider near base than the median height, rather evenly but not strongly convex, the median area with only a few very small punctures. Legs: Mesobasitarsite subrectangular, little more than 4 times 
longer than widest part which is about equal to length of longest hairs in the posterior fringe, the outer surface nearly flat, the distal angles about equally extended, neither acute but more or less rounded and without any pronounced emargination between; outer hind tibial surface granulose, with at most only a very weak longitudinal convexity, the widest part being sub­ equal to the length of longest hairs in the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite with posterior margin rather evenly arcuate except little more strongly so along the basal half, the outer surface for the most part rather strongly concave longitudinally, the bluntly acute distoposterior angle extended somewhat beyond the blunter distoanterior one with only a shallow emargination between, the widest part of this segment nearly 4 times wider than the length of longest hairs in the posterior fringe. Pubescence: Fine, dense, and even except that on most of head, scutellum, and abdominal T3-6 somewhat longer, uneven, and looser on abdominal T4-6; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe of medium length gradually becoming short distally, not dense; corbicular fringe composed of rather long dense nearly straight or weakly arcuate hairs except distal ones strongly curved; metabasitarsal posterior fringe short (gradually shorter distally), not dense, composed mainly of weakly arcuate to straight hairs. Color: Head and thorax usually black (though sometimes having an inter­ mixture of fine cinereous pile especially on the thoracic dorsum), abdominal venter (mostly) and T3 black, abdominal Tl-2 light golden yellow, T4-5 white, T6 with some white pile laterally otherwise dark; legs black. Wings rather evenly infumated with blackish brown, with some iridescent reflection under certain light.<p> 
<br>Worker. Length, 13.0 mm; width at wing bases, 5.5 mm; abdomen, 7.0 mm, width across T2, 6.0 mm; front wing length, 11.0 mm, width, 4.0 mm. This caste is in most respects like the queen except for the following: More diminutive in size and proportions in relation to the diagnostic morphological features; coloration and wings as in the queen except abdominal T4 has some black basally, especially laterally.<P> 
Male. Length, 17.5 mm; width at wing bases, 7.5 mm; abdomen, 9.0 mm, width across T2, 8.0 mm; front wing length, 15.0 mm, width, 4.5 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) markedly rounded trapezoidal, the narrow temples rather sharply rounded, most of vertex nearly flat transversely except slightly elevated laterally, the median height distinctly less than the widest part; vertical region nearly flat, mostly covered with small to medium (folli­cular) punctures, only weakly inclined toward the occiput; ocelli large, situated in a weak arc, closer together than i their diameters and far below the supraorbital line; ocellocular area very narrow equalling somewhat less than \ the diameter of an ocellus, virtually impunctate and traversed by a ridge adjacent to the compound eye; interocellar line almost 3 times that of the ocellocular line; compound eyes swollen, somewhat more broadly rounded above than below, their inner margins nearly straight, subparallel (i.e., convergent above); malar space shorter tnan the distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, irregularly weakly convex transversely and with at most only a few microscopic punctures; labrum little more than twice as wide as its median thickness, the ventral margin rather broadly arcuate, the callosities very weak and not sharply separated; flagellum nearly 3 times longer than scape, FI subequal to F3 which is about li times longer than short-rectangular F2. Legs: Mesoba- sitarsite elongate-subrectangular, at least 4 times longer than its widest part which is little more than i the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the outer surface more or less flatt­ ened, the distoposterior angle broadly rounded and much in recess of the blunt distoanterior angle without an emargination between; outer surface of hind tibia alutaceous, weakly convex longitudinally, the widest part equal to about f the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite subrectangular, its widest part equal to about J- the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, its distal end subtruncate, the outer surface weakly concave longitudinal­ ly, the distal end of segment attenuated having a posterior margin that is almost straight along the proximal three-quarters and broadly arcuate along the distal one-quarter. Pubescence: Very short, fine, and dense on most of head and thorax except longer and looser on vertical region and scutellum, most of that on abdomen of medium length, not as dense, the pile on T4-7 considerably longer and looser; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe rather long and loose, composed of nearly straight and weakly arcuate hairs the shortest ones at base and distal end; hind tibial posterior fringe ranging from short hairs basally to rather long hooked ones toward the distal end of segment, not dense; metabasitarsal posterior fringe composed of long, 
loose, nearly straight to weakly arcuate hairs, those at the base shorter and very short at the distal end of segment. Genitalia and seventh and eighth abdominal sterna (PI. XVII). Color: Head mostly brownish black except for considerable fine pale pile intermixed on the face; thorax brownish black except for a noticeable amount of pale pile intermixed on the anterior portion of mesonotum and posteriorly on the scutellum; legs mostly brownish black; abdominal Tl-2 light golden yellow, T3 and most of T4 black, the distal area of T4, of 5-7 covered with whitish (or dull white) pile, the abdominal venter largely pallid. Wings rather lightly and uniformly stained with brownish black.<p> 
Comments. Because of the paucity of specimens, very little can be said concerning morphological and chromatic variation in this taxon. A slight amount of variation in punctation on the clypeus was noted in the queens, and this feature in the worker appears to be relatively stronger. In most morphological respects 
(and coloration) the worker is proportionately very much like the queen as re­ described; however, one of the three queens [KU] at hand does have a noticeable amount of intermixed fine cinereous pile on most areas of its thoracic dorsum.Apparently this is one of the rarest bumblebee species in the Neotropical Region, being only poorly represented in very few of the many collections examined.
