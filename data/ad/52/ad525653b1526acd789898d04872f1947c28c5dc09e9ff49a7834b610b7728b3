<br>Comparisons. A. gratiosa is not a very common species. It has been collected during all months of the year and most frequently from Georgia and Florida. It comes in contact with persimilis, aurata, striata and bracteata, the females intergrading morphologically with both aurata and striata. Although the males of gratiosa are distinct and can usually be identified by the key characters (see exception below), females are more difficult to distinguish and the subtle differences can be difficult to recognize unless samples of each are available..* 
A. gratiosa is characterized chiefly by the propodeal characters in the females. The disc is as short as or shorter than the metanotum (Fig. 58). Its posterior border is usually well delineated, sometimes by a weak carina but more usually by its abruptly declivitous edge which has a weak, medial, V-shaped depression (Figs. 12, 20). The striae are fine, straight, and distinct, extending the full length of the disc; the posterior vertical surface is dull and granular, usually with short subhorizontal lineate irregularities (Fig. 76). The second metasomal tergum is granulose and similar to the following terga rather than minutely punctulate as is the first tergum. 
Females of gratiosa differ from aurata by the distinct, clear-cut features of the propodeal disc, by the complete, straight striae and the nature of the posterior face and second metasomal tergum. Although aurata may also have striae as fine and close together as those of gratiosa, they are rarely as straight or regular, nor do they extend onto the posterior margin of the disc (Fig. 57). Also, in aurata, the edge of the disc is less sharply posteriorly, usually without the medial V-shaped depression, and the posterior surface is smoother, shinier and lacks the lineate irregularities. In Texas, the two species are easily distinguished by the above characters and in addition, the first metasomal tergum is strongly punctate in aurata (Fig. 82) but finely punctate as usual in gratiosa (Fig. 83). In striata the striae usually extend the full length of the disc, the disc in form A. is frequendy as well delineated posteriorly as in gratiosa, possesses the V-shaped depression and may approxi�mate the bracket-shaped outline of gratiosa. However, if the striae are as straight and regular as those of gratiosa they usually are considerably coarser (fewer in number with greater space between them). If they are as fine as those of gratiosa they rarely are as straight, regular or well defined. In addi�tion, the posterior vertical surface of the propodeum in striata is smoother, shinier, with minute punctures and without the lineate granular irregulari�ties found in gratiosa, and the second tergum is similar to the first rather than the third or fourth terga. 
A. gratiosa is apparenly more closely related to striata A or aurata than to any other group. There is comparatively little variation and variation at�tributed to it in the past is seemingly partly due to misidentification based chiefly, if not exclusively, on the nature of the propodeal disc. When other characters are also used, identification becomes easier. The strict definition of gratiosa is based chiefly on the distinct and unvarying characters in the male, as opposed to the high degree of variability found in males as well as females of striata.<br><br> 
<br>Variation. The few variations that exist are associated chiefly with size and color. There is a wide variation in head size (Fig. 86) with the largest individuals being found in Louisiana and Alabama. A sample of 22 female specimens was measured from Florida, and all females from other states were measured. There is some indication that there may be caste differences in size although there is no correlation between width of head and season (i.e., large, small or average individuals may be found at any time of the year). Males show similar variations in size. The width of the head, with only a few exceptions is regularly greater than the length. 
Body color is rather uniformly yellowish green except in Florida where it varies from dark green to deep violet-blue. Most males (14 out of 18) and about 40% of the females are blue in Florida. In these specimens there are weak metallic reflections at the bases of the mandibles in females and on the hind tibiae of males, variations rarely found in green specimens. Only 1 out of 20 females from Georgia [Tifton, Ga., 6-13-96, Lot 209 (38*)] showed such reflections on the mandibles and two green Floridian males had slight reflections on the hind tibiae [Jacksonville 9-3-11 (9); Levy Co., Fla., 9-10-55 (10)]. 
The extent of brown on the clypeus of females is variable from specimen to specimen with no apparent regional trend, but it does not exceed one-third of the total length. 
The degree of roughness and amount of punctation on the supraclypeal area is also variable throughout the range. The frons shows very weak bluish reflections in most green specimens when the light is properly reflected from the surface but usually there are no readily visible spots of blue such as are found in neglectula. All blue-green specimens from Florida showed differen�tial coloring on the various parts of the body with the head usually darker (bluer) than the thorax, and the metasoma lightest (greenest) in color. 
In females from Louisiana the antennae are lighter below than above as usual, but the apical third of the flagellum is lighter above than the preceding segments. 
The scutum in females is roughly and closely punctured throughout the range but is less so than that of striata. Punctures are usually distinct but are very close or become indeterminate or rugose anteriorly and laterally. This rugosity is not correlated with size, color or distribution, although in Florida rugosity occurs with higher frequency in blue specimens than in green ones (in 45% of the blue and 9% of the green). 
The characters of the propodeum are remarkably stable in gratiosa, com�pared with the variability in the other eastern species. The sharply delineated disc is usually bracket-shaped and narrow in females, somewhat less distinctly so in males. Three of the seven females from Louisiana [2 from 8.5 a-l.ms. New Roads, 6-22-60 (20); Olivier, 5-04 (9)]; 2 of the 146 from Florida [Homestead 4-18-23 (32); Homestead 8-31-27 (9)] and one from Summer-ville, S.C. [5-10- (20) ] out of seven seen, were found with a more rounded outline although it is difficult to draw the line between one type and the other. When the posterior margin is subbracket-shaped, the medial V-shaped depression is not evident and the sharply angulate edge becomes abruptly rounded. The size of the striae varies little and only in the males do the spaces between striae vary. On the lateral sides of the propodeum of females there may or may not be very fine lineate rugae perpendicular to the anterior and ventral margins. They are present in all males seen with the exceptions noted below in Texas. Again, this seems to be a variation within populations and not correlated with season or distribution. 
The first sternum of the metasoma is variously metallic in females, strongly blue or blue-green in many darker specimens to brown with faint metallic reflections in others, especially the paler specimens. 
The amount of metallic coloration on the legs of females is relatively constant although any or all trochanters and femora may be slightly colored in addition to the always colored fore and hind coxae. 
All Floridian females have deep golden pubescence over all the body in�cluding the ventral parts of head and thorax, whereas in Texas, pubescence is paler with hairs whitish on the upper parts of the head and basal parts of the legs, in addition to the venter. The males do not vary in this character. 
Male genitalia have the inner lobe of the gonostylus as shown in Figure 34. The fingerlike projection averages slightly longer than in the other eastern species but enough variation occurs in each of the eastern species that distinctions cannot usually be made. The outer lobe has long, unbranched hair as in other eastern species. 
The two males from Texas [Nacogdoches, X-3-60 (42) and Victoria, VI-10-07 (9) ] are divergent individuals falling between gratiosa and persimilis, not fitting either group well but appearing to be most like gratiosa. On the basis of characters 1, 3 and 7, the specimen from Nacogdoches is most like gratiosa (the specimen from Victoria is without a head). The thoracic and metasomal characters of both specimens resemble those of either persimilis or gratiosa, and the hind basitarsus of each specimen is intermediate between the two species although more similar to gratiosa than to persimilis.
