Description. Queen. Length, 19.0 mm; width at wing bases, 9.5 mm; abdomen, 10.0 mm, width across T2, 11.0 mm; front wing length, 17.5 mm, width, 6.5 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) trapezoidal, the median height about equal to widest dimen­ sion, the temples rather sharply rounded, nearly transversely straight on the vertex; vertical region only slightly concave, mostly covered with small (follicular) punctures, moderately inclined toward the occiput; ocellocular area with some small inconspicuous punctures; com­ pound eyes noticeably more broadly rounded below than above, their inner margins slightly incurved, subparallel; ocelli of medium size, situated closer together than their diameters in a weak arc distinctly below the supraorbital line; interocellar line nearly If times greater than the ocellocular line; malar space little more, if any, longer than distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, very weakly convex transversely and nearly smooth; labrum little more than twice as wide as thick, its ventral margin mostly arcuate, the shelf not sharp and prominent, the tubercles somewhat reduced being flat and nearly smooth below and with some rather small punctures, their mesal summits rather rounded and separated by a somewhat shallow intertubercular depression that is somewhat wider than the length of FI; flagellum about twice as long as scape, FI nearly equal to the combined lengths of F2 and F3, the latter noticeably longer than subrectangular F2; clypeus about li times wider near base than its median height, rather evenly but not strongly convex, the median area with some small and a few medium punctures. Legs: Mesobasitarsite subrectangular being nearly 3i times longer than widest part which is slightly less than the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the outer surface nearly flat, the distal angles equally extended with a very shallow emargination between, the distoposterior one the sharper; outer hind tibial surface mid-longi- tudinally convex to near the distal end, granulose, the widest part not wider than the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite with outer surface broadly concave longitudinally, the widest portion at least twice as wide as the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the posterior margin rather evenly and weakly arcuate except a little more strongly so basally, the distal angles nearly equally extended with a shallow emargination between, the distoanterior one blunter than the subacute distoposterior one. Pubescence: Fine, dense, and of rather medium length except somewhat longer and looser on vertex, scutellum, and abdominal T3-5; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe composed of nearly straight hairs of medium length along the basal half gradually becoming short distally, not dense; hairs of cor- bicular fringe rather long except shorter basally, all straight or nearly so except distal ones bent, of moderate density throughout; metabasitarsal posterior fringe not dense, most hairs virtually straight, of medium length along the proximal half of segment, becoming very short distally. Color: Head black with an intermixture of some fine cinereous pile on the face and vertex; thorax cinereous with a considerable intermixture of black hairs especially on the dorsum and upper pleural areas, some of the pale hairs on the scutellum with a faint yellowish tinge; legs black; abdominal Tl-2 and most of the proximal two-thirds of T3 pale yellow to whitish yellow, the distal third of T3 predominantly black, T4 and sides of T5 yellowish white, the middle of T5 and all of T6 dark (black) as is most of the abdominal venter. Wings moderately and rather evenly stained with brownish black.<p> 
Worker. Length, 12.5 mm; width at wing bases, 6.0 mm; abdomen, 6.5 mm, width across T2, 7.0 mm; front wing length, 12.5 mm, width, 4.0 mm; with a few minor exceptions the diagnostic features of this caste are in relative proportions and appearance very similar to those of the queen, and in general the physical appearance of the pubescence is the same. Most specimens examined seem to have the posterior margin of the metabasitarsite somewhat more evenly arcuate from base to the distal end than in the queen. Color: The pattern differs from that of the queen in its intensity on certain parts of the body; the head and thorax 
(usually) are uniformly darker, having in the basic cinereous a somewhat greater inter­ mixture of black (or blackish) pile much of which often has a rufescent tinge; the abdomen of the typical specimen is colored like the queen except that T5 is usually entirely yellowish white; also, often much if not most of the yellow on abdominal Tl-2 might have a rufescent tinge. Wings colored like those of the queen.<P> 
Male. Length, 13.0 mm; width at wing bases, 5.5 mm; abdomen, 6.0 mm, width across T2, 6.0 mm; front wing length, 12.5 mm, width, 4.0 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, the narrow temples sharply rounded, virtually flat across the vertex, the median height distinctly less than the width of widest part; vertical region flat, for the most part covered with small (follicular) punctures, at most only very weakly inclined toward occiput; ocelli rather large, situated in a very weak arc distinctly below the supraorbital line and removed from one another by about i their diameters; ocellocular area shining and with very few minute (follicular) punctures in the ocular half, in width about equal to the diameter of an ocellus; interocellar line little more than twice that of the ocellocular line; compound eyes noticeably swollen, more broadly and evenly rounded above than below, their inner margins virtually straight and parallel; malar space nearly equal to the distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, weakly convex transversely and bearing some microscopic punctures; labrum between 2i and 2} times wider than its median thickness, the ventral margin nearly straight except round at the lateral corners, the callosities weak, not sharply separated and each with a few small punctures; flagellum nearly 3i times longer thai|the scape, FI equal to F3 and to about f the combined lengths of F2 and F3, the latter nearly H times longer than the short rectangular F2. Legs: Mesobasitarsite elongate-sub- rectangular, 4 times longer than its widest part which is less than i the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the outer surface flat, the sharper distoanterior angle extended considerably beyond the arcuate distoposterior angle, there being no conspicuous emargination between; outer surface of hind tibia convex longitudinally, alutaceous, the widest part of the segment equal to little more than i the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metaba­ 
sitarsite with outer surface shallowly concave longitudinally, the posterior margin nearly straight along the proximal half becoming weakly arcuate beyond, the segment distally attenuated (as to be about as wide as at base), the widest part about equal to £ the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe. Pubescence: Fine, dense (except on distal abdominal terga), rather uneven having some longer hairs on head, thorax (especially on dorsum in particularly the scutellum) and on most of the abdomen, being longer and looser on abdominal T5-7; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe mostly composed of long nearly straight hairs except those on the distal end are shorter and some are bent at their tips, not dense; hind tibial posterior fringe long except short to medium at base, the hairs straight or nearly so, the distal ones bent near their tips, denser than the corresponding fringe on mesobasitarsite; metaba­ sitarsal posterior fringe moderately dense, mostly composed of long nearly straight hairs except those along the distal end of segment are shorter. Genitalia and seventh and eighth abdominal sterna (PI. XVII). Color: Head and thorax cinereous intermixed with black (some of which might have a rufescent tinge) which often predominates especially on the dorsum and on the scutellum in particular; legs black; abdominal pile Tl-3 of typical specimens yellow, that on T1 paler (sometimes having a few black hairs on the lateral corners) and that on T2-3 usually having an orange tinge (frequently this is a distinct rufescent tinge), T4 entirely black except the distal margin has varying amounts of white and sometimes a noticeable amount of yellow might occur at the middle, T5 white (except sometimes some black might be evident basolaterally), T6-7 white, abdominal venter dark (brownish black) except exposed distal sterna white. Wings uniformly but not deeply stained with brownish black much as those of the queen.<p> 
Comments. I have not detected any troublesome morphological variations in this species other than the minor ones alluded to in the preceding redescription. Chromatically there is some variability, particularly in workers and males, that should be noted. The extent of the intermixture of black with the cinereous varies from a condition where the latter is clearly evident to one where it is largely ob­ scured by the black. The yellow on the abdomen, particularly on T2-3, is usually pale or orange-yellow but frequently it is reddish (yellow); the latter I have noted on several specimens, mostly from Peru.
