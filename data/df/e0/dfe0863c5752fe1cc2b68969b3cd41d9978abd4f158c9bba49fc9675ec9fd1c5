<br><br> 
This relatively rare manzanita bee from California is closely related to A. prolixa LaBerge; The female of monogonoparia is like that of prolixa in lacking the basal inferior mandibular tooth, in having elongate mouthparts and an entire labral process; The female of monogonoparia differs from that of prolixa by the paler vestiture, shorter malar space, less punctate clypeus, and the dull, tessellate, impunctate, faintly metallic blue, metasomal terga; The male of monogonoparia is like that of prolixa in the elongate mouthparts and usually simple labral process but differs in the impunctate, tessellate, often metallic blue, metasomal terga and the lack of inferior basal mandibular teeth. 
<br><br>

<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1-4 with basal areas impunctate or virtually so, finely tessellate, apical areas reticularly shagreened with obscure punctures; Pygidial plate with apex blunt, broadly rounded, internal raised triangle weak; Sterna as in prolixa. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. � Head white except as follows: fovea dark brown; upper part of face, along inner margins eyes, on vertex mixed with pale, on upper genal area dark brown; Thoracic hair pale, white to pale ochraceous except mesoscutum and scutellum with long dark hairs mixed with the pale; Leg hairs white except as follows: fore and middle tibiae, tarsi and posterior half to three-fourths of hind tibia with dark brown. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1-3 and often 4 with white hairs; terga 5 and 6 and apex of 4 with brown hairs; sternal hairs chiefly white; Tibial scopal hairs simple, long; propodeal corbiculum complete, with few or no internal hairs; trochanteral flocculus complete. 
<br><br> 
MALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. � N = 20; length, 9-11 mm; width, 1.5-2.0 mm; wing length, M = 3.64 � 0.134 mm; FL/FW, M = 0.92 � 0.006; FS1/FS2, M = 1.01 � 0.021. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. � As in female but tergal basal areas occasionally lacking metallic-blue reflections. 
<br><br> 
STRUCTURE. � Antennal scape length equals first two and one-fourth flagellar segments or more; flagellar segment 1 about as long as segment 2, shorter than segment 3, longer than broad; Mandible moderately long, when closed outer mandible extends beyond midlabrum by about one-fourth its own length or less; without basal inferior angle or tooth; Malar space, galea and glossa as in female; Maxillary palpus as in female; Labial palpus as in female but ratio about as 1.0:0.7:0.5:0.5; Labral process entire, triangular with rounded apex, moderately reflexed, shiny; labrum apical to process convex, shiny, without crista; Clypeus narrowed towards labrum, evenly punctate with punctures separated mostly by half a puncture width, slightly more near midline, without impunctate midline or subapical area; surface shiny to dulled by weak shagreening; Supraclypeal area, face above antennal fossae and vertex as in female; Genal area as in prolixa but dulled by fine dense reticular shagreening except in narrow zone adjacent to eye; Thoracic form and sculpturing as in female except pronotal ridge and angle more distinct. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1-5 sculptured as in female terga 1-4; Tergum 7 with narrow, dull pseudopygidial area; Sterna 2-5 sparsely punctate, dulled by coarse reticular shagreening; sternum 6 with apical margin flat. 
<br><br> 
Terminalia as in figures 137-141; note sternum 7 with truncate apex; penis valves with blunt tips and broad dorsolateral wings. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. � As in female except as follows: terga 1-5 with pale hairs; terga 6 and 7 with brown and pale hairs mixed; sternal hairs pale, without subapical fimbriae or these weak.
