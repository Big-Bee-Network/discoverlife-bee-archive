This is the type species of the subgenus Callandrena. It is very similar and closely related to A. verbesinae. It is further removed from A. accepta than is A. verbesinae, the latter being an annectant form between the other two species. A. manifesta is like verbesinae in having two submarginal cells, in the subgenal coronet being poorly developed, and in the trimaculated face of the female. It differs from verbesinae females in the scale-like thoracic hairs and the generally finer punctures. The male of manifesta differs from that of verbesinae by the shorter second flagellar segment, the generally finer punctation, the less impressed tergal apices, and the more distinctly rugulate propodeal enclosure. 
<br><br><br> 
FEMALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 2; length, 11-12 mm; width about 3-4 mm; wing length, 3.6-3.8 mm; FL/FW = 1.10; FOVL/FOVW = 2.67. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — Black except as follows: clypeus with shield-shaped median yellow macula equal to about two-thirds of clypeus; parocular areas to level of upper margin of antennal fossae yellow; flagellar segments 3-10 dark red below; wing membranes infumate, brown, especially apically; tegulae dark testaceous; tergal and sternal apices broadly hyaline, almost colorless; distitarsi rufescent.

Eyes about three and one-half times as long as broad, inner margins subparallel. Malar space linear, at least six times as broad as long medially. Mandible in repose extends about 1/4 its length beyond middle of labrum, bidentate, lacking ventrobasal lamella. Subgenal coronet poorly developed; hypostomal carina at apex angulate, without marked spine-like process. Galea densely tessellate, lateral surface less than half of dorsal. Maxillary palpus short, not exceeding galea, segments in ratio of about 1.2:1.4:1.0:0.7:1.1.

Labral process short, more than three times as broad as long, emarginate medially but not strongly bidentate. Clypeus somewhat flattened medially, strongly constricted just before apical margin, with large round punctures separated mostly by half a puncture width or more except along impunctate midline, surface shiny, shagreening delicate. Supraclypeal area with minute punctures separated mostly by one to two puncture widths, surface shiny, shagreening sparse, delicate. Genal area slightly broader than eye in profile, with minute round punctures crowded near eye and well separated posteriorly, surface shiny, unshagreened. Vertex short, above lateral ocellus equals about one and one-half an ocellar diameter, at apex punctures crowded, laterally with punctures separated by two or more puncture widths, surface moderately shiny, reticularly shagreened. Face above antennal fossae with crowded round punctures separated by half to one puncture width, shiny. Facial fovea more than half length of eye, about as 4 is to 7, rounded above, rather pointed below on eye margin, deeply impressed. 
<br><br> 
Pronotum with minute punctures separated mostly by more than one puncture width especially laterally, surface moderately shiny, with fine, reticular shagreening. Mesoscutum with small uniformly crowded punctures separated by less than half a puncture width, surface shiny. Scutellum and metanotum similar but the latter tessellate. Propodeum with enclosure with distinct complete transverse rugulae becoming finer toward apex, surface shiny, slightly shagreened; laterally with small punctures separated by about one puncture width becoming sparser on posterior surface, dulled by fine tessellation; corbicular area with sparse scattered punctures, reticular shagreening, surface shiny. Mesepisternum with small pink lines separated by one to two puncture widths, surface moderately dulled by coarse reticular shagreening. Metepisternum almost impunctate below, shiny, shagreening fine. Fore wing with two submarginal cells; vein lest m-cu meets second submarginal cell one-fifth or less beyond base of cell; pterostigma small, narrower than from inner margin of prestigma to wing margin. Middle basitarsus narrower than hind, parallel-sided. Tibial spurs and claws normal. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal tergum 1 with small round punctures separated by halt a puncture width or slightly more, somewhat smaller and more crowded in apical area except narrow impunctate apex, surface shiny, unshagreened; terga 2-4 similar but basally punctures slightly smaller and surface on tergum 4 with extremely delicate shagreening. Tergum 5 with punctures scattered with shagreening dulling surface. Terga 1-5 with apical areas slightly impressed. Pygidial plate V-shaped with blunt apex. Sterna 2-5 with scattered punctures basally becoming crowded near apex, surfaces slightly dulled by reticular shagreening. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Head hairs pale ochraceous with a few brown on vertex. Thoracic dorsum with short, highly plumose, scale-like hairs forming an opaque ochraceous mat over dorsum; laterally and ventrally normal in length and pale ochraceous. Propodeal corbicula incomplete anteriorly, with long, weakly barbed, internal hairs. Terga 2-4 with basal areas with hairs very short, almost simple, mostly decumbent, surfaces appearing almost hairless, with distinct apical pale fasciae. Tergum 1 with apical fascia restricted to small lateral patches. Terga 5 and 6 with white to yellowish long hair. Sterna 2-5 with long, suberect, plumose hairs forming subapical bands. Trochanteral flocculus complete by scanty. Tibial scopal hairs weakly barbed, appearing largely simple except under high magnification. Leg hairs pale ochraceous except inner surfaces tarsi yellow. 
<br><br><br> 
MALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 20; length, 9-11 mm; width, 2.5-3.5 mm; wing length, M = 3.49 ± 0.319 mm; FL/FW, M = 1.20 ± 0.034; FS1/FS2, M = 2.35 ± 0.043. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — Color as in female except as follows: clypeal yellow area usually more extensive, often without black peripherally except at lateral angles and along apical margin; flagellum without red below. 
<br><br> 
STRUCTURE. — Antennae not exceeding tegulae in repose; scape slightly longer than flagellar segments 1-3; flagellar segment 1 about equal in length to 2 plus 3 or slightly longer. Eye about 2 times :is long as broad, converging towards mandibles. Malar space, mandibles and galeae as in female. Hypostomal carina not spined at apex. Maxillary palpus exceeding galea by no more than length of last segment, in ratio of about 2.3:2.3:1.1:1.0:1.0:1.5. Labial palpus as in female but ratio about 2.8:1.0:0.8:1.4. Labral process bidentate, slightly reflexed. Clypeus as in female but more punctate basomedially and with sparse reticular shagreening slightly dulling surface. Supraclypeal area, genal area, vertex and face as in female but vertex very slightly shorter. Sculpturing of thorax as in female except as follows: propodeal enclosure with transverse rugulae more distinct, lateral and corbicular surfaces with coarse punctures and reticular shagreening similar to posterior surface. Mesepisternal and metepisternal sculpturing as in female but punctures separated by one-half to one puncture width and metepisternum with more abundant minute punctures below. Wings as in female. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1-5 like female terga 1-4 but punctures slightly more crowded and apical areas more distinctly depressed.

Leg hairs white or pale ochraceous except inner surfaces tarsi slightly yellowed; hind tibia with outer surface with hairs short, medially no longer than width of tibia or shorter. 
<br><br> 
TYPE MATERIAL. — The lectotype (CAS) female, here designated, and the lectoallotype (CAS) male, here designated, were collected at El Taste (3,400 feet), Baja California, Mexico. One female and one male paratype were part of the original type series and sent to T. D, A. Cockerell for examination (Cockerell 1898, p. 186). These have not been located. 
<br><br> 
DISTRIBUTION. — This species is known only from Baja California. In addition to the type series, two female and twenty males from Baja California collected by E. S. Ross and R. M. Bohart have been examined as follows: 1 female From Las Animas, Sierra Laguna, October 12, 1941; 1 male, 11 females from Big Canyon, Sierra Laguna, October 13, 1941; 9 males from La Laguna, Siena Laguna, October 14, 1941.
