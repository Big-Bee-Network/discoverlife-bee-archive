<br><br> 
Andrena flexa and the following two species (macra and/ace/a) differ from other members of the subgenus Leucandrena by the posterior hind tibial spur being flexed in the outer third, the distinctly punctate metasomal terga, and the relatively tall vertex. In addition the female has the propodeal corbiculum incomplete anteriorly and both sexes have terga 2-4 with complete or almost complete pale fasciae as described below. This species, together with the two following sister species, are placed provisionally in the subgenus Leucandrena, rather than in Thysandrena as previous authors have done, since a majority of characters are typical of this subgenus, especially the well-formed pronotal angles and dorsoventral ridges and the black male clypeus. It is possible that a new subgenus will be recognized for this small group in the future, based on the hind tibial spur shape. 
<br><br> 
FEMALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 20; length, 11-12 mm; width, about 3.5 mm; wing length, M = 4.23 ± 0.147 mm; FL/FW, M = 0.92 ± 0.003; FOVL/FOVW, M = 3.06 ± 0.40. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — Black except as follows: mandible with apical half or lest dark rufescent; wing membranes hyaline, infumate, yellowish brown, veins reddish brown; tibial spurs dark reddish brown; metasomal terga 2-4 with apical areas narrowly hyaline, colorless apically (on tergum 2 hyaline area equals one-third or more of apical area); tarsi dark reddish brown. 
<br><br> 
STRUCTURE. — Antennal scape length equals slightly less than first four flagellar segments; flagellar segment 1 as long as following two and one-half segments; segment 2 broader than long and slightly .shorter than segment 3 which is broader than long and shorter than 4; segments 4-10 quadrate to longer than broad. Eyes as in barbilabris but inner margins parallel. Mandibles, malar space, and galea as in barbilabris . Maxillary palpus as in barbilabris but segmental ratio about as 1,0:1.0:1.0:1.0:0.7:0.7.

Propodeum with dorsal enclosure opaque, roughened basally by obscure irregular rugulae, tessellate; outside of enclosure dulled by coarse tessellation and obscure punctures. Mesepisternum sculptured as in propodeum outside of enclosure. Fore wing with vein 1st m-cu meeting second .submarginal cell near or at middle of cell, Posterior hind tibial spur bent and somewhat S-shaped in oilier third. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal tergum 1 with basal area punctures distinct, separated by half to one puncture width, apical area punctures smaller and more crowded except in impunctate apical third. Terga 2-4 as in tergum 1 but basal area punctures more crowded in tergum 2 and less so in tergum 4. Terga 1-4 with surfaces shiny, shagreening weak or absent. Pygidial plate large, apex rounded, internal raise area lacking. Sterna 2-5 with basal area punctures separated mostly by two to three puncture widths, apical areas impunctate; surfaces dulled by reticular shagreened. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Pale ochraceous except as follows: ochraceous on vertex and thoracic dorsum; hind tibial plate and below with brown hairs; middle tibia with outer surface usually brown at least medially; terga 2-4 with apical pubescent fasciae white, that on tergum 2 interrupted medially by one-third or less of tergal width, (hat on tergum 3 narrowly interrupted medially, that on tergum 4 complete or almost so; terga 5 and 6 ochraceous to pale brown medially. Propodeal corbiculum incomplete anteriorly with long simple internal hairs; trochanteral flocculus weak, incomplete at extreme base. 
<br><br> 
MALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 2; length, about 10 mm; width, about 2.5 mm; wing length, 3.70-3.75 mm; FL/FW, 0.85-0.86; FS1/FS2, 2.14-2.31. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — Black except as follows: mandible with apical fourth rufescent; flagellar segments 3-11 dark reddish brown below; wing membranes hyaline, veins yellow to brown; metasomal terga 1-5 with apical areas broadly hyaline apically, rufescent basad; sterna 2-5 with apical areas hyaline, colorless to yellow; tibial spurs testaceous. 
<br><br> 
STRUCTURE. — Antennae in repose barely reaching scutellum; scape length equals first two and three-fourths flagellar segments; flagellar segment 1 more than twice as long as segment 2 and longer than 3; segment 2 broader than long; segments 3-11 longer than broad. Eyes each almost three and one-half times as long as broad, inner margins parallel. Galea, malar space, and labral process as in female. Clypeus with distinct round punctures separated mostly by half a puncture width or less, surface moderately dulled by fine shagreening, not opaque. Supraclypeal area, face above antennal fossae and vertex as in female. Genal area in profile broader than eye, broadest just above level of middle of eye; sculptured as in female. 
<br><br> 
Pronotum laterally with distinct humeral angle; dorsoventral ridge not evident in lower half; surface dull, tessellate. Thoracic sculpture and wing venation as in female (mesoscutum dulled by reticular shagreening). Posterior hind tibial spurs flexed as in female but only weakly so. 
<br><br>

<br><br> 
DISTRIBUTION. — Illinois to Oklahoma and Texas; April. 
<br><br> 
Andrena flexa and A. macra are closely related but seemingly distinct. In macra the pubescence is somewhat more deeply ochraceous, the clypeus lacks any evidence of a median impunctate line, and the abdominal terga at most are subfasciate toward the extreme sides. Lanham (1949), having no male by which to judge its position more accurately, suggested that flexa probably belongs in Cryptandrena or Thysandrena. With the male of macra available, it is the opinion of this writer that these two species are more properly placed in Gymnandrena, but this is open to debate.
