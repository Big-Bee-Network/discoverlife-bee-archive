Male: (1) Length 6 mm; head width 1.48 to 1.63 mm, averaging 1.56 mm, width slightly greater than length. (2) Color olive-green with yellow- green sheen, varying to yellow-green with golden sheen in some specimens; frons without bluish reflections; metasoma dark brown. (3) Mandible yellow-brown, only slightly rufous at tip, basal condyles usually dark brown; basal metallic reflections absent. (4) Clypeus with punctures shallow and widely spaced, sometimes closer basally; surface between punctures brightly polished. (5) Face broadly convex from apex of clypeus to vertex; supraclypeal area scarcely protuberant, impunctate but variably roughened. (6) Paraocular area smooth and polished below level of antenna with a few, widely spaced, minute punctures, becoming rougher toward frons; frons with dense mat of short white pubescence extending from antennal sockets to vertex. (7) Flagellum slightly darker above than below; scape and pedicel dark brown; last one and a half to two flagellar segments uniformly dark brown; pedicel and first segment each less than twice as wide as long. (8) Scutum shiny with satiny luster; punctures very weak, sparse and widely spaced (wider than own diameters), minute centrally, larger and closer laterally, becoming slightly deeper and contiguous to weakly and finely punctorugose anterolaterally; anterior margin smoothest medially, becoming rougher laterally; sculpturing exceedingly fine, shallow and indistinct (Fig. 79). (9) Tegula twice as long as wide. (10) Scutellum shiny, slightly roughened and punctate, punctures weak and widely spaced. (11) Pleuron shallowly and irregularly punctorugose, shallowly areolate anteriorly; surface between impression minutely roughened, dull. (12) Propodeum with disc about 1.75 times as long as metanotum; outline of disc V-shaped, posterior edge indistinct, smoothly and gradually rounded and shiny; striae distinct, fine, close, irregular, often branched, extending about three-fourths length of disc medially, reaching edge laterally; surface of disc beyond striae smooth, minutely r,eticulated, irregularly and minutely wrinkled; posterior vertical surface of propodeum and posterolateral corners shiny and smooth with widely spaced, minute punctures; lateral vertical surface of propodeum finely but regularly roughened becoming distinctly but shallowly punctate dorsally. (13) Legs dark brown; fore and hind coxae and femora with slight greenish reflections; tibiae and tarsi lighter brown at bases; hind basitarsus with erect hairs short, uniform in length, dense, slightly longer than width of segment; basal tuft indistinct. (14) Metasomal terga dark brown with slight bluish highlights and broad, reddish brown apical margins; first tergum polished anteriorly, with slight olive-green metallic reflections, smooth but less shiny dorsally, sparsely and minutely punctate; second and following terga smooth, dull, essentially impunctate but with widely scattered minute punctures; all sterna brown, finely and uniformly pubescent, without metallic reflections, with apical margins straight; surfaces smooth without reticulations or punctures. (15) Pubescence golden dorsally, white ventrally; face with mat of short, dense, white hair from antennae to vertex and longer, fine, golden hair dispersed over entire face; pubescence golden dorsally on thorax, entire metasoma and legs, white ventrally on head and thorax. (16) Genital capsule, seventh and eighth sterna and eighth tergum type 3 (Figs. 36,42,47).<p> 
Comparisons. This species has certain affinities with both the species of the north and those of the Pereirapis group. It is small, has the convex face and the similar fine, smooth sculpturing and discal shape, and has the straight margin of the fourth sternum in the male, all as in Pereirapis. But the genital capsule and the white apex of the clypeus of the male are more similar to those of the North American species than to Pereirapis. A. edentata is characterized by its round, convex face (Fig. 55), comparatively smooth, fine and very shallow body sculpturing, and usually by the yellow tipped antennae in the female. The clypeus is also flatter than in other North American species but comparative material is necessary to recognize this character. <p> 
Variation. The body color in both males and females varies from dark green to yellow-green. Although the bee is shiny, the color is dull, with olive-green tones. In females, the metasoma is green or only slightly suffused with brown in some of the darker specimens, or yellower green in lighter colored individuals. The metasoma is consistently brown in males.<p> 
There is greater variation of the head width to length ratio in females than in males. (However, the available males are nearly all from the same population.) Both the length and width are variable in females.<p> 
The clypeal punctures are generally rather uniform in males but variable in size, number and spacing in females. The basal punctures range from absent to crowded in both sexes.<p> 
The tips of the antennae of f.emales are brownish yellow in all specimens examined from Mexico and Costa Rica, the intensity of the yellow varying only slightly. However, in the holotype the antennal tips are brown, only inconspicuously paler than the rest of the fl.agellum. The one paratype seen, also from the type locality, has the antennal tips yellower than the holotype but darker than those from Mexico and Costa Rica. More specimens should be examined to see if this is individual or geographical variation.<p> 
There is slight variation in the quality of the roughening of the scutum among females. On about half the specimens the smoothness of the anteromedial edge extends down each side of the median suture, creating a transverse gradient in degree of roughness from the center line to the parapsidal lines. However, the anterolateral angles are no more roughened than other parts of the scutum in either sex.<p> 
The punctures on the scutellum are variable in size, number, spacing and depth among males.<p> 
There is little variation in the propodeal area of males, but in females the length of the striae is variable, extending more than two-thirds the length of the disc in only one specimen ["Rin Antonio" (9*)]. In this specimen, only a small area is unstriated medially, and the lateral striae are strong, ending abruptly at the edge. Although lateral striae usually reach the edge, they my be shorter in the larger specimens. The sloping horizontal area of the propodeum is usually only partially occupied by the disc laterally, the rest of the horizontal area being characterized by sculpturing similar to that of the vertical surface (Fig. 67). The posterior vertical surface in females varies from very smooth, broken only by widely scattered minute punctures, to weakly uneven or slightly roughened. There is also some variation in amount of roughening of posterolateral angles. There is little variation in the lateral vertical surface.<p> 
The metasomal punctures are similar in all specimens; however, in females they may vary somewhat in depth and are barely detectable in some individuals.<p> 
The color of the pubescence is difficult to determine in most specimens of both sexes, usually because of wear or dirt. Some appear lighter than others so that the dorsal pubescence appears to range from all white to golden. The short, dense facial pubescence is matted and gummy in most specimens, giving the face a yellowish cast. This facial hair is worn away on some speci- mens.
