Andrena bocensis is closely related to A. canadensis, but may be separated by its smaller size, the integument more shiny, and the clypeus more protuberant with fewer punctures. The two species are allopatric and, because of their close similarity, the possibility exists that A. bocensis is a subspecies of A. canadensis. However, I believe that A. bocensis is sufficiently distinct to warrant specific status.

Scutum with hairs very sparse on posterior two-thirds; scutellum naked except for sparse hairs on extreme lateral margins. Propodeal corbicula with scattered, long hairs in about anterodorsal third. Trochanteral floccus imperfect.

<br><br>

Penis valves in dorsal and ventral view with rounded, median expansion, apex bulbous; in lateral view as long as gonoforceps. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — White throughout. Clypeus with abundant, long hairs throughout; polished areas of scutum and scutellum with sparse, short vestiture.

Tergum 5 with medium length, sparse hairs throughout, on sterna 1 to 5 forming thick, subapical fimbriae. 
<br><br> 
VARIATION. — This species varies little as is evidenced in the female by the low standard deviations for wing length and the ratio of FL/FW. The higher standard deviation for FOVL/FOVW is due to the difficulty of accurately measuring the facial foveae. The limits of the foveae are indistinct, especially dorsally.
