<br><br> 
VARIATION. — The paratype female has the clypeus with a small, median ventral, impunctate area. In males the nearly shiny area dorsally on the scutum varies slightly in degree of reduction of tessellation. 
<br><br> 
TYPE MATERIAL. — The holotype female (KU) was taken at Epazoyucan, Hidalgo, Mexico by the University of Kansas Mexican Expedition on June 17, 1961, on flowers of Haplopappus sp. The allotype male (KU) was taken 8 km west of Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico at 2,469 m by Ellen Ordway on August 26, 1962.  Paratypes are designated as follows: 1 female, same data as holotype; 3 males, same data as allotype; 5 males (KU), Pachuca, Hidalgo, Mexico, by the University of Kansas Mexican Expedition at 2,437 m on July 28, 1954. 
<br><br> 
PARASITES. — None. 
<br><br> 
RANGE AND LOCALITIES. — This species has been taken from one small area of Mexico (map 2). A total of two females and nine males were examined. Three altitude records are as follows: 2,437 m, 2,469 m, and 2,531 m. All collection data are given under "Type material." 
<br><br> 
FLIGHT RECORDS. — Females were taken on June 17, and males were taken on July 28 and August 26. 
<br><br> 
FLORAL RECORDS. — The holotype female and paratype female were taken on Haplopappus sp., and both are carrying small quantities of pollen in their scopa. 
<br><br> 
Both sexes of A. pachucensis have the scutum nearly shiny, a character which separates them from the otherwise similar A. costillensis and A. columbiana.
