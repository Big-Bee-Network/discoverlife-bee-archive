(14) Metasomal terga dark green, usually suffused with brownish, yellowish or reddish with apical margins brownish, scarcely contrasting in color with rest of tergum; first tergum polished anteriorly with small, widely spaced punctures throughout; smooth but less shiny dorsally, with punctures variable, usually large, distinct and irregularly spaced; second tergum with punctures of same size but very closely spaced; sterna dark brown, smooth, with short inconspicuous white pubescence; first sternum with weak metallic reflections; fourth sternum broadly and shallowly emarginate. (15) Pubescence short and white over entire body. (16) Genital capsule, seventh and eighth sterna and eighth tergum of type 1 (Figs. 31, 40, 43).<p> 
Comparisons. The females of this species look most like persimilis or the striata-persimilis integrades. The size is small, at most the size of persimilis. The female can be distinguished from the other species found in the United States by its small size, the small but distinctly separated punctures on the scutum, and the lack of coarse roughening or rugosity anteriorly on the scutum (Fig. 78). It is further separated from gratiosa and neglectula by the very smooth posterior surface of the propodeum. Although this is also consistently smoother than aurata, persimilis or striata, the differences among these species in the posterior surface of propodeum are usually too slight to be recognized without comparative material.<p> 
The male is about the size and color of the male of persimilis but has the characteristics of a small striata with an emarginate fourth sternum, short basitarsal hair, and with the last segment of the antenna dark. The male genitalia are not perceptibly different from those of other members of the eastern species group, although there is a tendency for the process of the inner lobe of the gonostylus to be shorter and blunter than in other species (Fig. 31). Like the female, the male can be distinguished from all forms of striata by both its small size and its smooth but distinctly punctured scutum.<p> 
Variation. The greatest variation in bracteata is found in the characters of the propodeum. Males are in general more variable than females, the females varying chiefly in connection with differences in size. There is little geographical variation, probably due to the limited range and to the few specimens available outside of Texas.<p>As with most of the eastern species of Augochlorella, there is considerably more size variation in females than in males. This may be due to caste differences. In females the width of the head is usually greater than the length, but sometimes the width and length are equal. No such general pattern can be established for the males since the length-width ratio is highly variable, even though the overall variation in size is not great.<p> 
Color varies from dark green to yellow-green in both males and females, with no apparent correlation between size, date or location. There seems to be an unusual amount of discoloration, fading or bleaching in many of the specimens, especially on the metasoma. Among males, many of the specimens are coppery or reddish (see section on Specific Characters). In spite of the large proportion of specimens thus discolored, freshly caught specimens are probably normally green.<p> 
The number and size of punctures on the clypeus of the female is variable. When the punctures are sparse, the clypeus looks smooth, shiny and gently rounded, with the apex also smooth. This condition is apparent especially in the smaller (worker?) individuals. There is little variation in the size and density of punctures in males.<p> 
The supraclypeal area in both males and females is usually punctate, with the surface between punctures variably roughened. A female with a sparsely punctate clypeus will usually have a sparsely punctate supraclypeal area, with the central portion smooth and shiny. In the male the supraclypeal area may be shiny with few punctures (14% of the specimens) or with the upper half rough and lower half shiny (67%) or entirely rough (19%).<p> 
There is little variation in the punctation of the thorax except as related to the size of the individual bee. On particularly small females the punctures are exceeding small and close and may give the scutum the appearance of being granular rather than punctate. <p> 
The rugosity of the mesepisternum also becomes very fine on small females so that the surface may look similar to that of the metepisternum.<p> 
The disc is the most variable structure in this species. Although the edge is rounded in both males and females, it may be smooth and shiny, minutely or weakly roughened, or smooth with minute reticulations. In males the punctures of the posterior vertical surface of the propodeum may reach the dorsal part of the edge on some shiny specimens, and the edge may be more or less sharply defined (but never carinate) with shininess often associated with a rounded edge and dullness with a more distinct edge. A V-shaped depression is rarely apparent but may be indicated on those specimens with a relatively defined edge.<p> 
The shape of the disc shows little variation in females. In all cases it is semicircular, like that found in persimilis or in the persimilis-striata intermediates. There is somewhat more variation in males, with the outline varying from semicircular to roundly V-shaped, but not bracket-shaped as in striata form A. The striae may be of any thickness from very fine to coarse, especially in males, and may vary from straight to vermiform or, as in some small females, may be so irregular as to be unrecognizable as striae. Striae usually reach the edge of the disc, at least medially, where they are usually branched or irregular. In both sexes they are frequently slightly shorter on each side of the median line, where the edge then becomes thicker (see Fig. 66). The striae are straighter and more regular in the larger females than in smaller ones. There is as much variation in the characters of the disc as in persimilis and its intermediates, with some specimens resembling the small striata form c and others resembling persimilis.<p> 
The posterior surface of the propodeum is smoother in some females than others but never equals the smoothness of the anterior part of the first tergum. The roughening takes the form of fine granulations or irregularities on an otherwise smooth surface.<p> 
The lateral vertical surface of the propodeum ranges from rugose to finely roughened in the females and distinctly and evenly punctured to weakly roughened, largely punctorugose or finely reticulate, in the males.<p> 
The metasomal punctures are variable in both sexes, although the type series of 72 females, all collected at the same time and place, are similar in this feature. The punctures on the first tergum in females may be absent in some small specimens or small and irregularly spaced to large, distinct, and closely spaced. There is little indication of regional variation, although most specimens with large, close punctures are from southern Texas. The four specimens from Mexico have small to minute punctures. In males the punctures of the first tergum vary from very small to large, close to widely spaced, with no regional pattern evident. The second tergum of females usually has very small punctures regardless of the size of those of the first tergum. In males both the size and the spacing of punctures on the second tergum are variable, but usually the punctures are smaller than on the first. The third tergum in males sometimes has small but distinct punctures.<p> 
There are a few females with all white pubescence over the body. These are usually discolored individuals with brown metasoma (Victoria, Kingsville, etc.).
