<br><br> 
Has characters in common with A. (Ptilandrena) crawfordi Vier. in the male; the female is related to A. (A.) advarians Vier. (NOTE: now synonymized with A. vicinoides. -LL) 
<br><br> 
MALE. � Length 11mm; body black, mostly covered with black hair; temples rounded, head covered with black hairs except on vertex, clypeus convex, polished and more distinctly punctured than the face, clypearea present, sculpture of the clypeus not hidden by the moustache, labrarea nearly transversely oblong, subemarginate, polished, joint 3 of antennae:4::12:10, flagella almost straight in outline, antennae mostly blackish, the flagella dark brownish beneath, mandibles atypical, robust, not extending beyond the outer ridge of the labrum and falling short of the middle of their fellow, palpi nearly typical; thorax above and tubercles covered with an abundance of dark, dull ochreous hairs, hairs of dorsulum seemingly shorter than hair of mesopleura, dorsulum, wing membrane uniformly tinged with brown, legs blackish brown excepting the claws, which are rather dark amber, legs covered with blackish hairs; propodeum with its enclosure poorly defined, with indistinct rugae at base, elsewhere finely reticulated, rounded off at the apex, rest of upper face mostly with blackish hair, propodeal pleura with blackish hairs; abdomen with its tergum shining, almost polished, finely reticulated and indistinctly punctured, first tergite with erect blackish and a few pale ochreous hairs, second and following tergites with more or less erect blackish hairs, anal process truncate, almost parallel sided before the expanded apex, seventh sternite deeply emarginate.  hypopygium of the type found in A. (A.) lupinorum Ckll. but with the expanded end of the process recalling what is usually found in species of Trachandrena i.e. with the carina virtually horizontal and the inner edge vertical. 
<br><br> 
FEMALE. � Length 11mm; body black, mostly covered with black hairs: head almost entirely covered with black hairs, fovea filled with dark seal brown or blackish hairs, vertex with ochreous hairs, face shiny, indistinctly reticulate with adjoining or nearly adjoining fine punctures, clypeus at apex not elevated above the apical margin, convex, polished, punctured along its border like the face, clypearea present but poorly defined, the punctures scattered on either side of the clypearea, clypeus thinly hairy, its sculpture not all hidden by hairs, labrarea subemarginate when looked at from in front, but from below, deeply emarginate, labrum with a median longitudinal well between the labrarea and apical edge of labrum, antennae blackish, the fourth and following joints of the flagella brownish, mandibles typical, robust, palpi typical; thorax above covered with an abundance of pale ochreous hairs which are as long on the dorsulum as on the mesopleura, tubercles with ochreous hairs, mesopleura with black hairs, scutel hairy and sculptured much like the dorsulum, legs blackish except for the small joints on the tarsi, which are more or less dark brown, covered with brownish or blackish hairs, scopa typical, with black hairs throughout; propodeum with its enclosure poorly defined, dullish and finely reticulated, rest of upper face of propodeum covered with pale ochreous hair; abdomen with its tergum shining, covered with nearly erect blackish hairs except for some pale hairs on first and second tergites, apical edge of first, second, and third, and fourth tergites with a darkish brownish translucent border, pygidium nearly pointed at apex, with a triangular embossed area bounded by a channel, fimbria blackish. 
<br><br> 
HOLOTYPE. � Male, Chilcotin, B.C., May 19, 1920 (E.R. Buckell); No. 654 in the Canadian National Collection, Ottawa. 
<br><br> 
ALLOTYPE. � Female, Penticton, B.C., May 9, 1919 (E.R. Buckell) 
<br><br> 
PARATYPES. � 2 females same data as allotype.  In two paratypes with the same data as allotype the third tergite has few pale hairs of the abdomen confined to the first tergite.  A stylopized paratype from Agassiz B.C., April 7, 1921 (Sladen) also has pale hairs of the abdomen confined to the first tergite.
