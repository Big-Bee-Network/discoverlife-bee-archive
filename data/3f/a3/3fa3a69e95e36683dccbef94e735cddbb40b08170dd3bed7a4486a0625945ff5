Extracted from: Molly G. Rightmyer and Terry Griswold. 2010.Description of a new species of Osmia (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) from southwestern North America, with a redescription of the enigmatic species Osmia foxi Cameron Zootaxa 2512: 26–46<P>Diagnosis.—Females of O. palmula can be distinguished as belonging to Acanthosmioides by their mandibles, which are apically widened (two times wider than the median width), and by the relatively widely spaced lower teeth (apical tips of these teeth 1.3 times wider than apical tips of middle, i.e., second, and dorsal teeth) (Fig. 23). Within Acanthosmioides, females of O. palmula are most similar to O. unca Michener, but can be distinguished from that species by the relatively strong third tooth of the mandible (forming distinctly pointed tooth on margin nearest second tooth) (Fig. 23) and by the white hairs of the mesepisternum (O. uncahas dark hairs on the mesepisternum in the portion of its range that overlaps O. palmula, and paler hairs in more northern locations). Osmia palmula is known from other female Acanthosmioides by the following combination of characters: 1. Vertex, mesoscutum, scutellum, and T1 with white hairs (black hairs sometimes interspersed on vertex and mesoscutum); 2. Vertex lacking distinct depression posterior to lateral ocelli (or if with slight depression then this depression only immediately posterior to ocelli); 3. Gena in lateral view with ventral and dorsal margins rounded away from each other (hypostomal area convex); 4. Propodeal triangle with lower, lateral or entire half to third glabrous, strongly shining (Fig. 24); 5. Metasomal terga with wide impunctate bands at the apical margins (Fig. 25).<P>Males are readily distinguished by the enlarged, flattened F11, the apical tip of which is black (strongly contrasting with remainder of antenna, which is orange) and shining on the posterior surface (when antenna is directed upwards) (Figs. 27–29). The only other Osmia species with the combination of this type of antenna and no process on S2 is O. watsoni Cockerell; O. palmula can be distinguished from O. watsoni by the following two characters: 1. S4 midapically has a dense patch of coarse, orange-brown hairs plus an additional fringe of medially uninterrupted stout orange-brown hairs along the apical margin (Fig. 34) (in O. watsoni, the midapical patch of hairs on S4 is dark brown, and S4 lacks a medially uninterrupted fringe of hairs along the apical margin), 2. The gonoforceps has a distal process that is nearly three times as long as apical width (Figs. 35, 38, 39) (only two times as long as apical width in O. watsoni).<P>Description.—Female. Total length: 8.5–10.5 mm; forewing length: 6.4–7.2 mm; ocelloccipital distance: 0.5–0.7 mm; ocelorbital distance: 0.5–0.6 mm.<P>Color: Body gunmetal blue-green except brown to dark brown on mouthparts, labrum, most of mandible, most of clypeus, antenna (Figs. 20, 21), posterior two-thirds of tegula, legs excluding hind coxa, and most of metasomal terga; brown to metallic blue-green on basal most part of mandible, basal margins of clypeus, hindcoxa, apical margins of metasomal terga, and entire metasomal sterna. Forewing very weakly infuscate, slightly more strongly infuscate distal to cells and near C and R1 veins.<P>Pubescence: Clypeus below apical margin with lateral tuft of golden, medially directed hairs. White, minutely branched hairs on paraocular area, frons, mesepisternum, metepisternum, propodeum, posterior surfaces of femora, and inner surface of hind tibia; brown to black, stouter hairs on labrum, clypeus, inner surfaces of legs distal to femora excluding hind tibia (sometimes golden on tarsi), and scopa (sometimes with pale hairs laterally on scopa); golden to white, minutely branched hairs on remainder of body, usually with longer black hairs intermixed on mandible, vertex, and hypostomal area; forewing membrane covered with brown, short, simple hairs. Galea with hairs on lateral margin straight, 0.2–0.3 OD in length. Labrum with long hairs arranged in two curved, transverse rows, along subapical margin and approximately at midpoint, with additional fringe of minute hairs at apical margin.
