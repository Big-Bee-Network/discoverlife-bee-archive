Extracted by H. E Milliron. A Monograph of the Western Hemisphere Bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae; Bombinae) II. The Genus Megabombus Subgenus Megabombus. The Entomological Society of Canada, Ottawa 1970. pp. 239-330. <p> 
<br>Description. Queen. Length, 25.0 mm; width at wing bases, 12.0 mm; abdomen, 13.0 mm, width across T2, 12.0 mm; front wing length, 20.0 mm, widtk, 7.0 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, its widest dimension slightly greater than the median height, the temples rounded, vertex transversely nearly straight; vertical region for the most part weakly concave, well covered with small (follicular) punctures, slightly sloped toward the occiput; ocular half of ocellocular area with a few small (follicular) punctures, the ocellar half mostly smooth; compound eyes somewhat more broadly and evenly rounded below than above, their inner margins slightly incurved and noticeably closer together above; ocelli moderately large, closer together than their diameters and situated in a weak arc well below the supraorbital line; ocellocular line subequal to the interocellar line; malar space about equal to the distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, for the most part irregularly flattened and practically impunctate; labrum nearly twice as wide as its median thickness, the ventral margin arcuate, the shelf blunt and not prominent, the subconical tubercles distinctly flattened below and rather coarsely punctate above, their mesal summits well separated by an intertubercular depression that is about as wide as the length of FI; flagellum little more than H times longer than scape, FI nearly f as long as the combined lengths of F2 and F3 which are rectangular and nearly equal to each other in length; clypeus rather evenly but not strongly convex, the widest part near the base about li times wider than the median height, the median area rather well covered with small and medium irregular punctures except smooth medially below. Legs: Mesobasitarsite subrectangular, 4 times longer than its widest part which is at least twice as wide as the length of the longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the outer surface shallowly concave longitudinally, the distoposterior angle not spinate and extended only slightly beyond the blunt distoanterior angle without any prominent emargination between; widest part of hind tibia microscopically granulose, only weakly convex longitudinally anteriad of middle and behind mostly shallowly concave; metabasitarsite subrectangular, its outer surface broadly and shallowly concave, its widest part about twice as wide as the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the posterior margin very weakly arcuate from base to distal end which is nearly subtruncate. Pubescence: Noticeably absent on much of the temples; elsewhere on head, thorax, first two abdominal terga and T6 rather short, fine, dense, and for the most part even except longer and looser posteriorly on the scutellum and on abdominal T3 (mostly) — 5; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe composed mostly of short, straight hairs, rather dense; hind tibial posterior fringe shorter and denser along the basal one-third of margin, medially it consists of moderately long to long straight hairs, those beyond long and bent at or near the tips to shorter hairs that are more strongly bent at or near their bases at the distal end of segment; metabasitarsal posterior fringe composed of nearly straight rather short hairs along the approximate basal one-half of margin, not dense, becoming shorter and sparser beyond. Color: Head mostly (brownish) black with a slight amount of very fine cinereous pile posteriorly and ventrally on the temples and ventrolaterally on the face; thorax and legs black, abdominal Tl-2 and approximate basal two-thirds of 3 black, distal £ of 3, 4-5 white, T6 with some whitish pile laterally and medially with some short darker hairs and distally these are dense and have a ferruginous tinge, the abdominal venter dark except mostly whitish on the distal margins of S4-5 and largely so on S6 (hypopygium). Wings rather darkly and uniformly stained with brownish black, having a violaceous reflection under certain lights.<p> 
Worker.. Length, 16.0 mm; width at wing bases, 8.5 mm; abdomen, 8.0 mm, width across T2, 8.5 mm; front wing length, 14.0 mm, width, 5.0 mm. This caste is structurally similar to the queen in that the proportions are the same but more diminutive. Color: The pattern of the typical worker is similar to that of the queen except for the following: The face might be extensively intermixed with cinereous pile and this color be absent elsewhere on the head; intermixed cinereous pile usually is present on at least a part or all of the thoracic dorsum and even on the thoracic pleura especially above; the abdomen is like that of the queen but usually Tl-3 are totally black (c/. under Comments for further reduction of the abdominal white). Wing color like that of the queen.<p> 
Male, Length, 16.5 mm; width at wing bases, 8.5 mm; abdomen, 8.5 mm, width across T2, 8.5 mm; front wing length, 15.0 mm, width, 5.0 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, the rather narrow temples well rounded, vertex transversely nearly flat, the widest dimension a little greater than median height; vertical region almost flat and well covered with small (follicular) punctures, not appreciably inclined toward the occiput; ocelli large, positioned from one another by about £ their diameters in a weak arc much below the supraorbital line; ocellocular area not as wide as the diameter of a lateral ocellus and usually entirely smooth; interocellar line nearly 2£ times as long as the ocellocular line; compound eyes somewhat bulging, about equally rounded below and above, their inner margins nearly straight and parallel; malar space not quite as long as distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, irregularly flat and mostly covered with microscopic punctures; labrum about 2£ times as wide as thick, its ventral margins nearly straight except 
arcuate at the corners, the callosities inconspicuous and not well separated or delimited; flagellum nearly 3 times longer than scape, FI subequal to F3 which is just under 1£ times longer than rectangular F2. Legs: Mesobasitarsite elongate-subrectangular, nearly 4 times longer than its widest part which is almost £ the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, outer surface flat to shallowly concave longitudinally, the subacute distoanterior angle con­ siderably extended beyond the blunt distoposterior angle, at most with only a slight emargina­ tion between; outer surface of hind tibia microscopically granulose, for the most part longi­ tudinally moderately convex anteriad of the middle, the widest part of the segment equal to about f the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite similar to mesoba­ sitarsite except distoposterior angle is somewhat sharper and both distal angles are equally extended with shallow emargination between, the widest part of segment nearly equal to £ the length of longest hairs on posterior margin which is only slightly arcuate. Pubescence: Fine, dense, and rather short and even on most of thorax, perceptibly longer, looser, and rather uneven on vertex, posteriorly on the scutellum, most of abdomen especially T1 and distal terga; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe rather long along basal half of margin, gradually becoming rather short beyond, only moderately dense, composed of straight to weakly bent hairs; hind tibial posterior fringe rather long except shorter basally and distally, moderately dense, comprised mostly of straight hairs except those along distal third of margin are bent, some near tips and others at the middle; metabasitarsal posterior fringe for the most part long (shorter basally and distally), not dense, composed of straight (or nearly so) hairs. Genitalia and seventh and eighth abdominal sterna (PI. XVII). Color: Head and thorax black except for an intermixture of cinereous pile on the face (and slight on vertex), thoracic dorsum anteriad of wing bases, thoracic pleura, and scutellum; abdomen black except for noticeable amount of dull yellowish white laterally on anterior face of Tl, T5-7 with some whitish pile, or with some pale tipped hairs which also occur on the venter especially the distal sterna. Wings stained like those of the queen but somewhat less deeply so.<P> 
Comments. There is not much variation in this species except as pertains to the amount of intermixed cinereous pile on the head and thorax and the white on the distal abdominal terga; sometimes the latter is greatly reduced especially on workers and males. When Handlirsch (1888a: 228) described melaleucus he had before him only two workers neither of which bore any data as to time or place of capture and he incorrectly assumed them to be from the Oriental Region. These two specimens are not conspecific, one representing what Friese later (1903: 254) described as vogti. The melaleucus original description was so brief it could equally apply to two similar but separate species as it did. This Handlirsch species has been repeatedly confounded with volucelloides (Grib.) as well as with vogti (Fr.).
