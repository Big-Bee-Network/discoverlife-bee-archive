Description. Queen. Length, 20.0 mm; width at wing bases, 9.0 mm; abdomen, 11.0 mm, width across T2, 11.0 mm; front wing length, 19.0 mm, width, 6.5 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, the widest dimension slightly exceeding the median height, the temples evenly rounded, the vertex almost straight across; vertical region for the most part weakly irregularly concave, slightly sloped toward the vertex, largely covered with small irregular (follicular) punctures; ocellocular area with some small punctures on the ocular half, otherwise smooth; compound eyes somewhat more broadly and evenly rounded below than above, their inner margins subparallel except slightly incurved; ocelli of medium size, positioned distinctly closer together than their diameters in a weak arc that is definitely below the supraorbital line; interocellar and ocellocular lines almost equal; malar space about equal to distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, its weakly convex surface practically impunctate; labrum nearly twice as wide as median thickness, its ventral margin arcuate, the rather short shelf moderately sharp, the subconical tubercles flat beneath and irregularly punctate above, their mesal summits separated by an intertubercular depression that is slightly less wide than the length of FI; flagellum If times longer than scape, FI almost equal to the combined lengths of F2 plus F3, the latter nearly H times longer than quadrate F2; clypeus rather evenly and strongly convex, practically impunctate medially, a little wider near the base than its median height. Legs: Mesobasitarsite almost rectangular, little more than 3i times longer than widest part which is slightly greater than the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the outer surface nearly flat to very weakly concave, the distal angles blunt to rounded, each about equally extended with only a very shallow emargina- tion between; outer surface of hind tibia granulose, longitudinally convex mostly anteriad of middle, the widest part of segment about equal to the length of longest hairs of corbicular fringe; metabasitarsite subrectangular, its outer surface largely weakly concave, the widest part of segment equal to nearly 3 times the length of longest hairs along the posterior margin which is rather evenly (but not strongly) arcuate from near base to distal end which is subtruncate. Pubescence: Dense (or compact), fine, and strikingly even except somewhat longer and looser posteriorly on the scutellum and on abdominal T4 and T5; sparse to absent on the middle of Tl; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe not well defined (scattered), the hairs mostly straight, those along the proximal half of margin of medium length then gradually becoming shorter and somewhat sparser beyond; corbicular fringe moderately long and dense consisting mostly of straight (or nearly so) hairs except the distal ones are bent; metabasitarsal posterior fringe short, not dense, consisting of nearly straight hairs the longest of which occur along the approximate proximal third of margin then gradually becoming shorter and sparser beyond. Color: Head black with some fine yellowish pile intermixed on the face; thorax typically golden-yellow (extending onto the mesopleuron often to near leg bases), remainder of thorax black including a well-defined moderately wide interalar band that is sometimes wider at the middle; legs black; abdominal Tl-2 typically golden-yellow though often much or most of the pile laterally on Tl and that on the basal half (more or less) of T2 is tinged with con­ spicuous reddish brown; T3 typically entirely black; T4 black basally, remainder of tergum whitish (or white); T5 and mostly laterally on T6 whitish (or white); abdominal venter dark (blackish) with some pale pile on the distal sterna especially 4 and 5 (c/. under Comments for more details on color). Wings stained with brownish black though not intensively so (cf. under Comments).<P> 
Worker. Length, 14.5 mm; width at wing bases, 7.0 mm; abdomen, 7.5 mm, width across T2, 7.5 mm; front wing length, 14.0 mm, width, 4.5 mm. Except for the smaller body size, the diagnostic morphological features of this caste are similar to those given for the queen but some of the characters are proportionately more diminutive. The color pattern of typical workers is like that of typical queens except that the shade of the yellow pile usually is paler and ordinarily the mesopleuron is more extensively black dorsally than in the typical queen. Usually the wings are paler especially those of lighter individuals (c/. under Comments).<P> 
Male. Length, 17.0 mm; width at wing bases, 7.5 mm; abdomen, 8.0 mm, width across T2, 7.0 mm; front wing length, 15.0 mm, width, 4.5 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, the median height subequal to the widest part, the narrow temples rounded, the vertex transversely slightly depressed; vertical region irregularly flattened, only slightly inclined toward the occiput, well covered with small (follicular) punctures; ocelli of medium size, positioned much closer together than their diameters in a weak arc far below the supraorbital line; ocellocular area very narrow, without any concavity, having at most very few punctures and a weak ridge adjacent to eye margin; interocellar line at least 3 times as great as the ocellocular line; compound eyes somewhat swollen, about equally rounded above and below, their inner margins for the most part straight and divergent below; malar space about equal to the distance between [and including] mandibular articulations, practically impunctate and only weakly convex transversely; labrum about twice as wide as median thickness, the ventral margin straight except arcuate at the corners, transversely slightly concave below the callosities which are weak, moderately punctate, and well separated; clypeus densely pubescent; flagellum 3i times longer than scape, FI distinctly longer than rectangular F2 and about equal to F3 which is about li times longer than F2. Legs: Mesobasitarsite narrowly subrectangular, nearly 4f times longer than widest part which is about f the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the proximal one-third of the outer surface weakly convex the distal two-thirds weakly concave longitudinally, both distal angles rounded, the distoanterior one considerably in advance of the distoposterior one without much emargina- tion between; outer surface of hind tibia only weakly microscopically granulose, the widest part of segment about f the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite elongate-subrectangular, little more than 4 times longer than widest part which is at least equal to f the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the posterior margin nearly straight along its proximal half, beyond only weakly arcuate, the distal end of segment subtruncate. Pubescence: In character that on the body very similar to that of the queen except somewhat less dense especially on the abdomen; mesobasitarsal fringe not dense, consisting of long mostly straight hairs that gradually become shorter distally; hind tibial posterior fringe moderately dense, consisting mostly of long hairs (except shorter basally) that are straight (or nearly so) except those distally are quite strongly bent near their tips; metabasitarsal posterior fringe not dense, composed of nearly straight long hairs, those at the proximal and distal ends of margin being shorter. Genitalia and seventh and eighth abdominal sterna (PI. XVII). Color: Head black with considerable yellow intermixed on the face especially on the clypeus; thoracic dorsum golden-yellow with a rather well defined black interalar band of medium width, the yellow extending down about half way onto the pleura in front and beneath the tegulae; legs black; abdominal Tl-2 golden-yellow, T3-4 black, T5-7 with considerable whitish pile intermixed with darker hairs especially laterally on T5-6. Wings uniformly stained with light brown.<P> 
Comments. Structurally this species is rather constant as I have noted few variations of minor significance and these pertain largely to the worker, some specimens of which might have a few scattered conspicuous punctures on the middle of the clypeus. Often the posterior margin of the worker metabasitarsite is not quite as arcuate as that of the queen. Chromatically this taxon is puzzlingly variable, es­ pecially in the worker where the yellow in the pattern might approach a straw color. The queen is more stable having the abdominal T3 nearly always black, but some­ times a varying amount of yellowish pile will occur on this tergum, and some or most of this lighter pile might be tinged with light reddish brown or even ferrugi­ nous. Frequently light colored specimens occur in the worker caste; on such indi­ viduals the black interalar band is usually narrow, the yellow on the mesopleuron extends nearly to the leg bases, and the abdominal dorsum might be entirely yellow 
with even a loss of most of the whitish pile normally at the distal end; this condi­ tion approaches the form described as “sulfuratus”. Sometimes the whitish at the distal end of the abdomen becomes yellowish and might even be tinged with ferruginous, this latter condition in the male approaches the form described as “rafocaudatus”. The males are similarly variable as the workers, and of both I have examined all gradations from the typical to these variable extremes. The amount or extent of yellow on the mesopleuron is very variable in workers (es­ pecially) and males, much less so in queens. The wing color varies from that given in the foregoing redescription to a pale brownish (wings of lighter specimens).<p> 
The varieties described as “steinbachi” and “cinctus” are typical tucumanus which is related to P. (C.) robustus (Sm.). When Friese (1911a: 457) described robustus v. sulfuratus he had before him two queens and 10 workers all from Salta, Argentina. It is unfortunate that he described it as a distinct form as the material 
(all of which I have examined) consists of a composite of two taxa neither of which belong to robustus; most of the specimens belong to tucumanus but some belong to opifex (Sm.). Although there was a paucity of specimens before them, neither Franklin (1913: 147) nor Frison (1925a: 150) could agree with Friese that his form was robustus (Sm.). Thus, for more than 5 decades considerable taxonomic confusion has existed in this area.
