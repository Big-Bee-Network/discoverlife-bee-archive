This small species is known from only a few specimens from New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A. daeckei can be easily recognized by the form of the mouthparts in both sexes. The galeae are opaque, the surfaces dulled by coarse, granular tessellation, and covered by short blunt erect hairs, and the maxillary and labial palpi are reduced in length. Of the Scrapteropsis only A. kalmiae has mouthparts of this type in addition to daeckei and these two Andrena are closely related. Atwood (1934), Viereck (1907) and Mitchell (i960) all missed seeing these mouthpart characters or did not realize their uniqueness and thus had some difficulty in separated daeckei from other species of Scrapteropsis (or Trachandrena). 
<br><br> 
A. daeckei is very close to A. kalmiae and whether or not these two forms should remain as distinct species or be considered as well-marked races of one species cannot be decided at present. They are here kept as distinct species until such time as additional specimens provide us with more conclusive evidence. A. daeckei can be separated from kalmiae by the shorter vertex (at least in females), the sparser mesoscutal punctures and the longer apical areas of terga 2 - 4 of the female. 
<br><br>

Scutellum sparsely punctate except peripherally, punctures larger than on mesoscutum, surface shiny. Metascutum as in imitatrix. Propodeum as in imitatrix but dorsolateral and posterior surfaces coarsely rugatulopunctate and lateral (corbicular) surface rugulate at least in posterior half to three-fifths.

<br><br> 
Metasomal tergum 1 with basal area punctures separated mostly by two to four puncture widths, apical area punctures separated mostly by half to one puncture width, surface shiny, slightly shagreened if at all. Tergum 2 with apical area distinctly longer than one-third length of tergum; basal area punctures as in tergum 1, apical area punctures slightly sparser than on tergum 1 especially basad, surfaces moderately dulled by distinct reticular shagreening. Terga 3 and 4 similar to 2 but punctures progressively sparser and shagreening denser. Pygidial plate and sterna as in imitatrix. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Generally white except thoracic dorsum and vertex pale ochraceous. Form and disposition of hairs as imitatrix except as follows: galeae and maxillary palpi with abundant, extremely short, erect hairs; propodeal corbicula without plumose hairs anteriorly, internal hairs simple; terga 2-4 with apical pale fasciae absent or weak, usually broadly interrupted medially if present. 
<br><br> 
MALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 2: length. 7 mm; width, 2 mm; wing length, 2.35-2.55 mm; FL/FW, 1.04-1.13; FS1/FS2, 0.89-1.00. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — Generally as in female but terga 2-5 more broadly hyaline apically, apical areas translucent yellow to dark red basad of hyaline margins; tegulae rufescent. 
<br><br> 
STRUCTURE. — Antennae short, not surpassing scutellum in repose; scape as in imitatrix; flagellar segments as in imitatrix but segment 1 may be as long as 2. Eyes. mandible, malar space and galea as in female. Maxillary palpus as in female but segmental ratio 1.0: 0.9: 0.7: 0.5: 0.3: 0.5. Labial palpus as in female but ratio 1.0: 0.6: 0.3: 0.3. Labral process and labrum as in female. Clypeus as in female but puncture smaller. Supraclypeal area. genal areas, face above antennae and vertex as in female. Facial fovea absent. 
<br><br> 
Thoracic sculpturing as in female except as follows: propodeum with lateral surfaces coarsely rugatulopunctate (like dorsolateral and posterior surfaces). Wing venation as in female. Hind tibia narrow, not inflated subapically. broadest near apex. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal tergum 1 with basal area punctures small, sparse, separated mostly by five puncture widths or more. apical area punctures separated mostly by two to three puncture widths, surface shiny. Terga 2-5 similar to tergum 1 but surfaces at least lightly shagreened (shagreening progressively more coarse posteriorly). Sterna much as in imitatrix, sternum 6 flat and emarginate apically. 
<br><br> 
Terminalia as in figures 37-41; note the following: sternum 7 with only 2 or three minute hairs apically, emargination deep. v-shaped: sternum 8 with apical narrow part broadened basad: gonostyli sparsely haired: gonocoxite dorsal lobe long: penis valve tip blunt. 
<br><br> 
Venture. — White to cinereous: tergal fasciae absent. Galeae and maxillary and labial palpi with abundant short hairs as in female.

<br><br> 
DISTRIBUTION. — Maine to New Jersey; May. No detailed description of daeckei has ever been published, as it was established originally merely by including it in a key. Thus the description above, made from a paratype female, is the first. Both sexes were included originally, but there is considerable doubt concerning the identity of the male. Specimens identified as such that have been seen are very similar to kalmiae Atwood or to A. (Mimandrena) imitatrix Cresson. Consequently that sex has been omitted here.
