<br>MALE�Length 11 mm., breadth of abdomen 4 mm.; black, clypeus bright yellow, lab- rum and mandibles black in large part, antennal flagellum brownish-testaceous beneath, piceous above, apical tarsal segments becoming dull testaceous, spurs testaceous, and tegulae black; wings subhyaline basally, becoming very faintly clouded apically, veins testaceous to brownish; abdominal terga rather narrowly brownish-hyaline apically; cheeks considerably narrower than eyes; clypeus somewhat protuberant, its median length considerably greater than half the distance between eyes below; eyes slightly convergent below; shorter side of basal segment of flagellum very slightly longer than pedicel, segment 2 five or six times this length; punctures of clypeus rather coarse and close, but shallow and inconspicuous, labrum more finely and closely punctate; punctures rather close and deep on lateral areas of face below antennae, becoming somewhat finer and more distinctly separated above, fine and irregular on vertex back of ocelli, and rather fine and close on cheeks anteriorly, becoming somewhat more sparse posteriorly and below; scutum and scutellum shining, punctures of scutum coarse, deep and well separated medially, becoming somewhat finer and very close laterally and anteriorly, much finer and rather sparse on scutellum medially, becoming somewhat closer and coarser laterally; pleura rather dull between quite coarse, close and shallow punctures; propodeum posteriorly somewhat shining, with scattered, rather coarse, shallow punctures, dorsal area impunctate in mid-line, becoming rather irregularly and shallowly punctate laterally, lateral faces quite coarsely and rather deeply punctate, punctures becoming considerably finer and closer below; basal abdominal tergum with rather deep and distinct but rather fine and well separated punctures medially, these becoming somewhat closer and finer at each extreme side, the apical impressed margin entirely impunctate; discs of terga 2 and 3 with fine, well separated, quite regularly distributed punctures, becoming slightly closer at extreme sides; discs of terga 4 and 5 much more finely, deeply, distinctly and closely punctate; punctures of tergum 6 obscured by dense pubescence; tergum 5 not distinctly angulate or spinose laterally, but tergum 6 with a small, carina-like, triangular, lateral process at each side; pubescence of head largely creamy-white, with a very few dark hairs around ocelli; scutum and scutellum with rather abundant, erect, fuscous pubescence, the scutum very narrowly pale pubescent anteriorly and along lateral margin to the propodeum, thorax and legs otherwise whitish pubescent; basal abdominal tergum with copious, elongate and erect, whitish pubescence anteriorly and laterally, largely bare otherwise; terga 2 and 3 with basal, whitish fasciae that are usually covered by the preceding plates; terga 2-5 with apical, dense, whitish fasciae, largely occupying the rather narrow, depressed, apical margins, discs with dark pubescence that is short on tergum 2, becoming progressively more elongate on the more apical segments, with elongate black hairs more or less overlying the white fasciae; pubescence of terga 6 and 7 entirely fuscous or black; pygidial plate strongly elevated toward base, with subparallel, lateral, carinate margins, abruptly constricted before apex which is rather broadly subtruncate; sternum 7 as shown (fig. 83); sternum 8 similar to fiinbriatci but more broadly rounded apically; genital armature as in fimbriata. <br>

<P> 
This species was known previously only from the type material. 
Three additional females have been examined by the author. The 
data for these are listed below: 
FLORIDA: Crescent City: 1 2, April 30, 1955, H. E. and 1\'1. A. 
Evans. NORTH CAROLINA: ,,yhite Lake: 2 2 2, l\tIay 20, 1934, 
on Opuntia sp., T. B. :Mitchell. The specimens are in the collections 
of Cornell University, Ithaca, New York, North Carolina State College 
at Raleigh, and the University of Nebraska State l\tluseum at 
Lincoln.
