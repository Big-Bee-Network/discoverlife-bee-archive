The vestiture is wholly white throughout, a character which separates this species somewhat from the other species within the Citrinihirta group, but the general integumental sculpture and the metasomal vestiture, particularly that on tergum 2, shows that this species lies within the Citrinihirta group.

One female from Purdy, Washoe Co., Nevada, has the clypeus with slightly more than half its length projecting below the eyes. One female and 1 male from Reno, Washoe Co., Nevada, have the pubescence tinged with yellow and the tergal fasciae thicker than other specimens, and the mediotarsal and distitarsal segments are yellow throughout. One male from 24 km S. Headquarters Malheur Refuge, Harney Co., Oregon, has the pro- mediotarsi and -distitarsi normal, the meso- mediotarsi and -distitarsi more yellow, and the meta- mediotarsi and -distitarsi light yellow.
