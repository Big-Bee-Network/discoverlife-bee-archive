This small Mexican species is named in honor of Dr. H. A. Scullen who collected the type series. A. sculleni is a small species related to A. aliciarum. Both sexes of sculleni have yellow clypei and large yellow parocular maculae, short vertices and punctate terga as in aliciarum. Both sexes differ from those of aliciarum in having longer thoracic hairs (not mat-like on mesoscutum and scutellum), in the terga having apical areas barely impressed and not as coarsely punctate and in having the clypeus impunctate medially. The female of sculleni is distinctive in that the mesoscutum and scutellum have large medial areas with extremely short, erect, dark brown hairs with long white hairs scattered throughout. The male of sculleni differs from that of aliciarum also in its broader head and short first flagellar segment as described below. A. sculleni seems to be related also to A. humeralis which it resembles in having a weakly developed humeral angle on the pronotum. However, this is much less developed than in humeralis and the dorsoventral ridge is lacking completely. It may be considered as an annectant form between the humeralis and the accepta groups. 
<br><br> 
FEMALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 13; length, 10-12 mm; width, 4.0-4.5 mm; wing length, M = 3.84 ± 0.138 mm; FL/FW, M = 1.06 ± 0.004; FOVL/FOVW, M = 3.08 ± 0.091. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — Black except as follows: clypeus yellow except apical fourth and triangular maculae below and mesad of tentorial pits; parocular areas with yellow maculae which laterally reach or almost reach tip of facial fovea and inner margins to level of posterior clypeal margin; apical third of mandible rufescent; flagellar segments 3-10 red below; wing membranes hyaline, veins dark reddish-brown; tegulae slightly rufescent; terga with apical margins narrowly hyaline, yellowed basad and narrowly rufescent just basad of hyaline areas; tibial spurs testaceous; distitarsi dark rufescent. 
<br><br> 
STRUCTURE. — Scape length equals first four and one-half flagellar segments; flagellar segment 1 longer than 2 plus 3, segment 2 about equal in length to 3 and shorter than 4. Eye about three and three-fourths as long as broad, inner margins subparallel. Malar space, mandible and galeae as in aliciarum. Maxillary palpal ratio about 1.2:1.0:0.7:0.8:0.6:1.1, Labial palpal ratio about 3.1:1.0:0.9:1.3, segments strongly flattened. Labral process short, broad, entire or extremely weakly emarginate medially. Clypeus shaped as in aliciarum, punctures irregular laterally, separated mostly by one to two puncture widths or more, impunctate medially, surface shiny. Supraclypeal area with small round punctures separated mostly by half a puncture width, surface shiny, weakly shagreened. Genal areas slightly broader than eye in profile, punctures minute, separated by two to four puncture widths, surface shiny. Vertex as in aliciarum but punctures sparse except immediately above facial foveae and surface dulled by fine reticular shagreening. Facial fovea as in aliciarum. Face above antennal fossae with abundant longitudinal rugulae almost reaching ocelli medially, moderately shiny. 
<br><br> 
Pronotum with weak humeral angles, without dorsolateral ridge, with suture running somewhat anteriorly and dorsally from just below posterior lobe unusually deep and broad and crossed by several short distinct rugulae, surface dulled by fine irregularly reticular shagreening. Mesoscutum and scutellum as in aliciarum but punctures slightly smaller and surfaces somewhat dulled by extremely fine shagreening. Propodeum with dorsal area with a median longitudinal rugula and fine irregular lateral transverse rugulae, surface dulled by fine tessellation; dorsolateral and posterior surfaces tessellate, punctures inconspicuous; corbicular area shiny, with coarse reticular shagreening and scattered punctures. Mesepisternum with shallow punctures crowded anteriorly, sparse posteriorly, surface dulled by reticular shagreening. Metepisternum dulled by reticular shagreening in upper third, shiny below. Tegulae impunctate. Wing venation as in aliciarum. Middle basitarsus expanded, broader than hind basitarsus medially. Tibial spurs and claws normal. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1-4 with apical areas with minute punctures separated mostly by one to two puncture widths; tergum 1 with basal area punctures minute, separated by two to five puncture widths; terga 2-4 with basal area punctures separated mostly by two puncture widths; terga 1-4 with surfaces moderately shiny, finely shagreened. Pygidial plate V-shaped, apex rather sharp, internal raised triangle present, margins closely approach margins of plate. Sterna 2-5 as in aliciarum but punctures more abundant in subapical areas. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — White or pale ochraceous except as follows: mesoscutum and scutellum with white hairs peripherally, medially with extremely short, dark brown hairs with long white hairs (four or five times as long as the brown) scattered throughout; terga 5 and 6 medially pale brown; terga 2-4 with basal area hairs short, sparse, dark brown, suberect. Terga 2-4 with apical pale pubescent fasciae, often extremely narrowly interrupted medially on tergum 2 and weak medially on 3. Propodeal corbicula, trochanteral flocculus and tibial scopa as in aliciarum. 
<br><br> 
MALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 2; length, 8-9 mm; width, 2.0-2.5 mm; wing length, 3.25-3.58 mm; FL/FW, 1.00-1.06; FS1/FS2, 1.00-1.11. 
<br><br> 
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — As in female except as follows: parocular yellow macula near eye margin extends to level of lower margin of antennal fossa or slightly above, this lateral arm broader than in female. 
<br><br> 
STRUCTURE. — Antennae long, in repose reaching well beyond tegulae; scape length equals about first two and two-thirds flagellar segments; flagellar segment 1 longer than segment 3; segments 3-11 longer than broad. Malar space as in female. Mandible as in female but longer and thinner. Galeae as in female. Maxillary palpal ratio about 0.7:1.0:0.8:0.6:0.5:0.9. Labial palpal ratio about 2.0:0.6: 0.5:1.0. Labral process bidentate, broad, strongly reflexed. Clypeus broad, protruding beyond ends of compound eyes by one-fourth median length, not much flattened, punctures as in female. Supraclypeal areas as in female, but punctures sparser. Genal area distinctly broader than eye in profile, sculptured as in female. Vertex and face above antennal fossae as in female. 
<br><br> 
Thoracic sculpturing as in female except as follows: mesoscutal and scutellar punctures slightly sparser; lateral surfaces propodeum dulled, tessellate, with punctures more abundant. Fore wings with vein 1st m-cu meeting second submarginal cell near middle or only slightly beyond. Tibial spurs and claws normal. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1-5 sculptured as in female terga 1-4 but punctures slightly sparser, especially in apical areas and surfaces shinier. Narrow pseudopygidial area present. Sterna 2-5 as in female. Sternum 6 flat, apical margin broadly and shallowly emarginate. Sterna 7 and 8 as in gardineri but sternum 7 with few or no apical hairs and sternum 8 with neck region hairs sparser. Genital capsule as in gardineri but gonocoxite lateral lobes slightly more acute in dorsal and ventral views and hairs extremely sparse, penis valves not much expanded basally, and dorsal lobe of gonocoxite slightly shorter. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Generally white except as follows: mesoscutum and scutellum medially with short (but not as short as in female), dark brown hairs mixed with long white; terga 2-5 basal areas with short, suberect, sparse, dark brown hairs; distitarsi with inner surfaces yellow. Terga 2-5 with weak but distinct pale apical pubescent fasciae interrupted medially especially on tergum 2. Sterna 2-5 with subapical 1mibriae not distinctly distinguishable from more basal long hairs. 
<br><br> 
TYPE MATERIAL. — The holotype female (OSU), allotype male (OSU), and one male paratype (INHS) were collected by H. A. Scullen, October 16, 1957, at 4500 feet altitude, at Saltillo (14 miles N.), Coahuila, Mexico. Twelve female paratypes (OSU, INHS) were also collected in Mexico by H. A. Scullen as follows: Gomez Palacio, (25 miles N.W.), Durango, at 4150 feet altitude, 6 females, October 18, 1957; Hidalgo de Parral (70 miles S.), Chihuahua, at 6500 feet altitude, 6 females, October 24, 1957.
