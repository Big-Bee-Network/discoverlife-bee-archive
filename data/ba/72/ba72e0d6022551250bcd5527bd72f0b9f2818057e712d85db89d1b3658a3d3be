A. levigata is a distinctive Mexican species related to A. dreisbachorum and perpunctata. Like dreisbachorum, levigata has the integument in part with a metallic lustre. In the case of levigata he head and thoracic are nommetallic and the metasomal terga are dark metallic blue-black or greenish blue-black, whereas in dreisbachorum the head and thorax are metallic and the terga nonmetallic. A. levigata differs from both dreisbachorum and perpunctata by the almost complete lack of punctures on the terga, by the generally shiny, unshagreened integument, and by the darker vestiture as described below.

Tegulae normal, impunctate. Scutellum sculptured as in mesoscutum. Metanotum at summit unshagreened and with minute punctures separated by one puncture width or more, laterally and anteriorly dulled by reticular shagreening and small punctures. Propodeum with dorsal enclosure as long as metanotum medially, sides straight, basally with transverse or oblique rugulae, apically with extremely fine transverse rugulae, rugulae usually interrupted medially, surface moderately shiny; dorsolateral and posterior surface with round punctures separated mostly by one-half to one puncture width, surface scarcely dulled by fine reticular shagreening, posterior longitudinal median sulcus shallow, as broad as long; corbicular area with small punctures widely scattered in anterior half, fine rugulae extending up and back from coxae in posterior third, surface shiny, with coarse reticular shagreening. Mesepisternum with deep, moderate-sized punctures, anteriorly separated by half a puncture width or less, posteriorly sparse, surface shiny, unshagreened Or with delicate reticular shagreening. Metepisternum shiny, extremely delicately shagreened, lower portion impunctate, upper 
<br><br> 
rd with minute, well-spaced punctures. Middle basitarsus almost parallel-sided, slightly narrower than hind basitarsus. Fore wings h three submarginal cells, middle cell receives vein 1st m-cu well beyond middle of cell; pterostigma large, broader than from inner margin prestigma to wing margin; otherwise as in perpunctata. , Claws and tibial spurs normal. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1-4 almost impunctate, with minute scattered punctures especially near extreme base or hidden under apical fasciae; surfaces shiny, unshagreened or with extremely delicate, reticular shagreening. Pygidial plate U-shaped with slightly diverging sides, apex rounded, internal raised triangular area present. Sterna 2-5 with narrow apical areas impunctate, basal areas with minute scattered punctures becoming denser near apical areas but still separated by two to more puncture widths, surfaces moderately shiny, reticularly shagreened. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Head white except vertex, upper part of genal areas, and facial foveae with blackish-brown hairs. Thorax pale ochraceous : except as follows: mesoscutum and scutellum dark brown medially, ochraceous peripherally, mesoscutal dark patch extends forward at. least to anterior margins tegulae and usually beyond (holotype); mesepisternum pale anteriorly, dark brown posteriorly, or almost entirely dark brown (holotype), or dark brown intermixed with ale hairs anteriorly and dark posteriorly; propodeal hairs dark brown except dorsal fringe of corbiculum. Tergum 1 glabrous except dark brown hairs at sides (becoming pale near apex). Terga -4 with ochraceous to bright golden (holotype), dense, apical fascia of short, plumose hairs, that on tergum 2 narrowly interrupted r thinned medially; basally glabrous or with sparse pale hairs Specially near extreme bases. Terga 5 and 6 with long brown hairs, paler at sides. Sternal hairs brown, pale at sides.

Eye, malar space, mandible and galea as in perpunctata. Maxillary palpus as in simulata but segmental ratio about 1.2:1.0:0.9:0.8:0.8:1.0. Labial palpus as in simulata but segmental ratio about 2.2:1.0:0.8:1.0. Labral process trapezoidal in outline with broad, shallow, median emargination, slightly broader than three times greatest length.

Sternum 6 flat, apex extremely shallowly and broadly emarginate medially. 
<br><br> 
Genitalia and sterna 7 and 8 (Figs. 252-256) similar to those of perpunctata but differ as follows: dorsal lobe gonocoxites longer. gonoforceps less hairy; penis valves broader near base; volsellae with fewer minute teeth; sternum 7 with median length greater, hat sparse; sternum 8 with apex broader, scalloped or sinuate. 
<br><br>

Sterna 2-5 with distinct, subapical fimbriae of moderately long, slightly curled, pale ochraceous, barbed hairs. Leg hairs white to pale ochraceous except tibiae and tarsi dark brow(tm) (base of tibiae occasionally pale). 
<br><br> 
TYPE MATERIAL. — The holotype (MSU) female and the allotype (MSU) male from Morelia, Michoacan, Mexico, were collected on September 22, 1957, by R. and K. Dreisbach. Two female and two male paratypes (MSU, INHS) were collected with the holotype and allotype. An additional female paratype (SECK) is as follows:
