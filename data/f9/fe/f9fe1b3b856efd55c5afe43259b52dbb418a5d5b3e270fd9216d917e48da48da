<b>Overview</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Notes:  Female with only 3 teeth, but at least in some specimens there can be a very very tiny tooth on the side of the second tooth, near the cutting edge.Hairs on sternites noticably longer than most species except S6 which is abruptly short haired and and nearly jet black...more densely haired than other species.  Tongue suppppppperrrrr long extending almost to end of abdomen.  Male.  The prominent projecting plate off of T6 is convex unlike almost all other Megachile species, appears almost like a cowling.  Rim of T6 deeply and broadly concave with a projecting rounded lobe at each end.  S6 triangular in the center and pointed, visible from above because of the concave part of T6.
