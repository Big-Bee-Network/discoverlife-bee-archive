Legs: Mesobasitarsite little more than 3 times longer than wide, subrectangular except attenuated at base, rather sharply emarginate distally, distoposterior angle acute spinate, outer surface concave; outer surface of hind tibia mostly finely granulose (or alutaceous), moderately convex longitudinally along anterior (ventral) half, only wider distal half relatively free of pubescence; metabasitarsite little more than twice as long as greatest width, distinctly wider at auricle than at distal end which is subtruncate with shallow emargination and sub­ acute distoposterior angle, posterior margin rather strongly evenly arcuate on proximal half, virtually straight on distal half, outer surface broadly concave. Pubescence: Fine, uneven, most on thoracic dorsum rather short and dense, elsewhere moderately long and dense; hind tibial posterior fringe not thick, comprised mostly of straight hairs equal in length to greatest tibial width, proximal half of outer hind tibial surface with noticeable semi-erect hairs; meta- basitarsal posterior fringe moderately long basally, becoming short on distal half. Color: Head black. Thoracic dorsum yellow ocher on approximate anterior half and on interalar area mesad of tegula; interalar area predominantly intermixed with black, forming narrow rather indefinite interalar band pointedly extended medially forward but black on mesoscutum posteriorly and 
on scutellum anteriorly, with sharp median extension onto latter; scutellum brownish yellow and black intermixed, dominantly black anteriorly and at posterior margin; remainder of thorax black. Legs black except limited pale pile on coxae, trochanters, femoral bases, the hind tibial fringe with slight ferruginous tinge. Abdominal Tl-2, T3 (narrowly at base) black; remainder of T3, all T4 yellow ocher; T5 black except finer hairs on distal margin and at sides with yellowish-ferruginous tinge; T6 mostly with pale ferruginous tinge; venter for the most part pale yellow ocher. Wings infuscated with light brown, venation brown to black.<p> 
<b>Worker</b>. Length, 12.0 mm, abdomen, 6.0 mm; width at wing bases, 6.0 mm, width across abdominal T2, 7.0 mm; length of front wing, 11.0 mm, width, 4.0 mm. Structurally similar to queen but differs in the following respects. Head: Vertex weakly convex, somewhat more ex­ tensively punctate; ocelli about equal, in nearly straight line, lateral ones touching supraorbital line; labral tubercles less prominent, labral shelf considerably narrower but somewhat more distinct; FI noticeably longer than quadrate F2, little less than f of F2 and F3 combined. Legs: Outer hind tibial surface rather evenly convex mid-longitudinally, much less pubescent than in queen; metabasitarsal posterior margin less strongly arched proximally. Pubescence: Similar to that in queen but somewhat more even. Color: Throughout much as in the queen except yellow on mesoscutum more extended posteriorly, nearly covering it. Wings less deeply in- fumated.<p> 
<b>Male</b>. Length, 12.0 mm, abdomen, 6.0 mm; width at wing bases, 6.0 mm, width across abdominal T2, 7.0 mm; length of front wing, 12.0 mm, width, 4.0 mm. Head: Frontal outline triangular (excluding mouthparts), little higher than wide; vertex weakly convex, sloped posteriad, covered with moderate-sized punctures except smooth and polished in front of median ocellus; interior one-half of ocellocular area with few punctures and continued smooth notice­ ably posteriad and lateroanteriad; ocelli less than their diameters apart, situated in weak arc, lat­ eral ones on supraorbital line; ocellocular line less than interocellar line; compound eye about 2i times higher than wide, inner margin weakly incurved above; clypeus about as high as wide at base, rather strongly evenly convex, covered with moderate-sized punctures except sparsely and weakly so on mid-vertical area; labrum pubescent, nearly rectangular, evenly punctate except on weak basal callosities, transversely slightly concave, anterior (ventral) margin rounded at corners, otherwise nearly straight; mandibular space slightly convex, smooth except for micro­ scopic sculpture and pubescence, nearly as long as distance between (and including) mandibular articulations; flagellum nearly 4 times longer than scape, median segments weakly arcuate ventrally, FI distinctly longer than F2 which is only slightly longer than wide, about f length of either F3 or F4. Legs: Mesobasitarsite subrectangular, attenuated basally, subtruncate distally, distoposterior angle acutely rounded, outer surface nearly flat; hind tibial outer surface rather uniformly convex mid-longitudinally, evenly covered with fine semi-erect pubescence; metabasitarsite subrectangular, rather abruptly attenuated basally, distal end truncate except for shallow emargination, distoposterior angle a rounded right-angle, posterior margin weakly evenly arcuate, outer surface mostly concave mid-longitudinally. Pubescence: Moderately long, loose, rather dense on thorax, and uneven throughout; hind tibial posterior fringe not dense or even; metabasitarsal posterior fringe longest on proximal half (subequal to greatest width of segment) and that on distal half distinctly shorter. Genitalia and seventh and eighth abdominal sterna (PI. XV). Color: Stronger pubescence on head entirely black, finer pile on face and vertex behind ocelli pallid under strong light; thoracic dorsum to beyond wing bases yellow ocher, extreme posterior margin of mesoscutum and scutellum dominantly brownish black intermixed with some yellowish pile, thoracic pleura dark except intermixed with yellowish anteroventrad of tegulae; legs entirely dark except yellowish on coxae, trochanters and basoventrally on femora, hind tibial (in part) and metabasitarsal posterior fringes with faint ferruginous tinge under strong light; abdominal Tl-2, T3 (most of basal half) brownish black, remainder of T3 and all T4 yellow ocher, T5 dominantly yellow ocher laterally intermixed with dark pile which pre­ dominates near center, T6 dominantly brownish black with fine pile on distal margin having ferruginous tinge, T7 pale ferruginous, abdominal venter yellowish. Wings moderately uni­ formly infuscated with brown, venation dark brown to black.<p> 
Comments. This species appears to be rather uncommon and confined to a limited area in Mexico, presumably only at the higher elevations. Except for meager information about the altitude where some specimens have been captured, little is known about the habitat, behavior, and biology of the species. In the past, it has been confused with fervidus californicus (8m.), from which it is distinctly different struc­ turally. In the female, the clypeus is less strongly punctate, FI is shorter, the malar space a little shorter, the posterior margin of the metabasitarsite more strongly and less evenly arched, the body form smaller and more compact, and the pubescence longer and shaggier than in /. californicus. Franklin (1913), who had but two queens, incorrectly believed that the species belonged to the Pratorum group and that Pyrobombus (P.) vosnesenskii (Rad.) was its closest relative; of course, a comparative study of the female mesobasitarsite, wing venation, antennae, and mandibles reveals that this cannot be so, and that the species really belongs to the Mendax Line. Additional characteristics afforded by the male show that trinominatus is closely related either to nigrodorsalis (Fkln.) or to digressus Mlrn., from both of which it easily can be distinguished by its chromatic pattern or by the structural differences given in the keys.
