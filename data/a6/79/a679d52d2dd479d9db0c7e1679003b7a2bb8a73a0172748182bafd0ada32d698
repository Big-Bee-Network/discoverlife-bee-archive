This strikingly beautiful Mexican species is not closely related to any of the foregoing species. It is placed here, near the discreta ((group of species, because of the agreement of a number of characters such as the size and shape of the facial foveae, the form of the mandibular base, the shape of the sixth sternum of the female and of the male, the shape of the middle basitarsus of the female, etc. A. repanda can be told from almost all other species of Callandrena in either sex by the apical areas of the terga which are strongly constricted with the margins turned upwards. In addition, the dorsal enclosure of the propodeum ends abruptly posteriorly, the division f line between dorsal and posterior surfaces being almost carinate. These characters, together with the black integument and hairs of the head, thorax, base of the metasoma and legs, and the bright golden metasomal apical segments, make this species easily recognizable. 
<br><br> 
FEMALE. MEASUREMENTS AND RATIOS. — N = 3; length, 14-15 mm; width, about 4 mm; wing length, M = 4.88 ± 0.426 mm; FL/FW, M = 1.07 ± 0.011; FOVL/FOVW, M = 3.04 ± 0.074.  
INTEGUMENTAL COLOR. — Black except as follows; mandible with apical half rufescent; flagellar segments 4-10 dark brown below; tegulae piceous; wing membranes infumate throughout, brown, veins reddish-brown; tergum 1 with apical area translucent, brown; tergum 2 with apical area hyaline, yellow and extreme apex of basal area orange (in darkest specimen apical area translucent, brown); tergum 3 with apical area hyaline, yellow, basal area orange in apical fourth or fifth and irregularly blotched with orange across extreme base (in darkest specimen apical area translucent, yellow-brown, without orange in basal area); tergum 4 entirely orange, apical area hyaline (in darkest specimen tergum 4 as in tergum 2 of pale specimen); terga 5 and 6 entirely yellow-orange with hyaline apex on 5 and rufescent pygidial plate; sterna 2-5 narrowly hyaline apically, red; sternum 6 yellow-orange except apex; distitarsi rufescent; tibial spurs rufescent to somewhat yellowish.

<br><br> 
Pronotum normal, with minute punctures and fine reticular shagreening moderately dulling surface. Mesoscutum with small deep round punctures separated mostly by half a puncture width or less and fine reticular shagreening dulling surface; parapsidal line about as long as from its posterior end to margin of scutum. Scutellum similar to mesoscutum but shagreening coarser. Metanotum similar to mesoscutum but punctures shallower and denser, shagreening coarse. Propodeum with dorsal enclosure ending abruptly posteriorly (almost carinate), opaque, tessellate with slight basomedial roughening; dorsolateral and posterior areas with moderate-sized shallow punctures separated by one to two puncture widths and fine tessellation dulling surface; corbicular area shiny, with small punctures in anteroventral third or more, surface with fine shagreening. Mesepisternum like mesoscutum but punctures sparser especially posteriorly and surface dulled by reticular shagreening. Metepisternum like corbicular area in lower two-thirds except impunctate and shinier, upper third with minute punctures and reticular shagreening. Middle basitarsus with evenly curved sides, about as broad as hind basitarsus medially. Tegula normal, impunctate. Wings with venation as in discreta but pterostigma narrow. Claws and tibial spurs normal. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal tergum 1 with crowded minute punctures apically, sparse punctures at extreme sides, impunctate in basal three-fourths, surface moderately shiny, finely shagreened. Terga 2-4 with apical area strongly impressed near base and margins reflexed; apical area impunctate, shiny; basal area with small round punctures separated mostly by half a puncture width or less, surface shiny, weakly shagreened. Pygidial plate V-shaped with narrowly rounded apex, with broad shiny impunctate margin and narrow triangular punctate internal area but internal triangle not raised. Sterna 2-5 with apices impunctate, extreme bases impunctate, with crowded, minute punctures subapically, becoming sparser towards base. Sternum 6 with apical tubercle which is circular in outline and flattened. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Head and thorax with black hairs; those of thoracic dorsum moderately short. Metasoma with first two segments with brown hairs, third segment with brown shading into gold and bright gold on remaining segments (in dark specimens first three segments black, fourth segment brown shading into gold apically, last two segments bright gold). Tergum 1 with apical fringe of moderately long, suberect hairs, base glabrous. Terga 2-4 with short, subdecumbent, highly plumose hairs, sparser on tergum 2, more abundant posteriorly. Sterna with well-formed subapical fimbriae but undeveloped medially on each sternum. Leg hairs black except scopal hairs brown and inner surfaces tarsi reddish-brown. Corbicula with long, internal, apically plumose hairs in anterobasal third, without anterior fringe of long curled plumose hairs other than of the internal type. Trochanteral flocculus complete, dense. Tibial scopal hairs highly plumose throughout. 
<br><br>
