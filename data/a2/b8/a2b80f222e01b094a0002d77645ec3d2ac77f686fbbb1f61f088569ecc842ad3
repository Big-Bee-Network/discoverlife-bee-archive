Extracted from: Molly G. Rightmyer1, Terry Griswold1, Michael S. Arduser.  2010. A review of the non-metallic Osmia (Melanosmia) found in North America, with additional notes on palearctic Melanosmia (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae)  ZooKeys 60: 37–77<P>Diagnosis. Osmia nearctica is one of two members of the xanthomelana species group 
in North America; characters to distinguish it from the other member of that group, 
O. maritima, are given under that species (see above). 
In the Palearctic, O. nearctica is most similar to O. xanthomelana, but can be differentiated 
from that species by the following characters: In females, the propodeal 
triangle is shining but weakly shagreened throughout (Fig. 36) (O. xanthomelana 
with entirely polished, strongly shining lower half of the propodeal triangle), the 
outer hind tibial spur is only about half the length of the hind basitarsal segment 
(O. xanthomelana with outer hind tibial spur nearly three-fourths length of hind 
basitarsal segment), and the lower margin of the mandible has a distinct, translucent 
fl ange that curves away from the condylar ridge (O. xanthomelana with the 
lower margin of the mandible opaque, forming a ridge that is parallel to the condylar 
ridge). Th e hairs of the mesepisternum tend to be dark brown in O. nearctica, 
while in O. xanthomelana the hairs tend to be pale yellow to white, and the hairs 
of the hypostomal area tend to be denser in O. nearctica than in O. xanthomelana.<P>In males, the propodeal triangle is weakly shagreened throughout in O. nearctica 
(Fig. 41) (O. xanthomelana with entirely polished, strongly shining lower half of the 
propodeal triangle); the lower tooth of the mandible is only slightly longer than the 
upper tooth in O. nearctica (in O. xanthomelana the lower tooth of the mandible is 
much longer than the upper tooth and the entire apical margin of the mandible is 
conspicuously wider than the middle, approaching the look of male Acanthosmioides); 
T7 midapically has a shallower emargination in O. nearctica (Fig. 43) than in O. xanthomelana; 
the S6 midapical truncation is clearly emarginate in O. nearctica (Fig. 47) 
(O. xanthomelana with S6 truncation not emarginate); and the apical tip of the gonoforceps 
(apical to subapical swelling) is more rounded in O. nearctica (Figs 49, 50) (in 
O. xanthomelana the apical tip is more pointed). Osmia nearctica can be diff erentiated 
from O. maritima and O. alticola by the microscopic hairs on the underside of thefl agellar segments (O. maritima and O. alticola with conspicuous hairs about half the 
width of the fl agellar segments).<P>Description. Female. Figs 9, 10, 33–38. Total length: 9.0–11.5 mm; forewing 
length: 6.5–7.2 mm; length of lateral ocellus to preoccipital margin 0.6 mm; length of

on mouthparts, labrum, mandible, fl agellar segments, legs, and apical margins of 
Figures 64–70. 64, 65. Osmia maritima, male, genital capsule 64 Dorsal view 65 Lateral view. 66–68.

truncation one-fi fth width of sternum, truncation slightly wider than deep, apical 
margin of truncation very weakly emarginate midapically (Fig. 47; S6 sometimes 
folded along longitudinal length, thus increasing appearance of midapical emargination); 
S6 with lateral edge strongly folded, bulbous in appearance in ventral view. 
Gonoforceps strongly swollen subapically, apical to swelling with fl attened, narrowed 
process (Figs 45, 46, 49–51).<P>Distribution. Canada from Yukon, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut 
southeast to Ontario and Quebec.<P>Etymology. Th e name “nearctica” is derived from the Greek arktikous, meaning 
northern or arctic, and is in reference to the known distribution of this species in 
northern regions of the New World (i.e., Canada).
