Agapostemon leunculus Vachal 1903. Lectotype 2, Museum National D'Histoire Naturelle,  
<p>Paris.  
<br>Agapostemon vulpicolor Crawford 1906 (new synonymy). Type 2, U.S. National Museum.  
<br>Agapostemon nasutus var. ater Friese 1916 (new synonymy). Type 5, whereabouts unknown.  
<p>From the 30 syntypes of Agapostemon leunculus in the Paris Museum,  
<br>I have designated a female as lectoholotype. I have seen the type of A.  
<br>vulpicolor but not that of A. nasutus ater. As noted by Michener (1954),  
<br>A. nasutus ater is not conspecific with A. nasutus. I have seen a female  
<br>"Typus" (not a type, but identified by Friese) of A. nasutus ater from the  
<br>U.S. National Museum labeled, "Costa Rica,/San Jose/1903." Friese did  
<br>not describe the male, probably because he was expecting to find something  
<br>with the "hog-nosed" aspect of A. nasutus. The only difference between  
<br>A. leunculus and A. nasutus ater is the coloration of the pubescence and  
<br>integument of the head and the dorsal surface of the thorax. I have not  
<br>found any differences among the males that can be correlated with the varia-  
<br>tion among females. Because I have seen females intermediate in coloration  
<br>(see discussion of variation) I am considering the difference between A.  
<br>leunculus and A. nasutus ater as local variation.  
<p>Distribution. Agapostemon leunculus is found in Mexico exclusive of  
<br>the central plateau, as far north along the eastern coast as ten miles south-  
<br>west of Pharr, Texas (1 2 collected by C. D. Michener) and as far north along the western coast as Rosario, Sinaloa. It has been collected in the  
<br>mountainous regions of southern Mexico but has not been taken on the  
<br>Yucatan Peninsula. It has also been collected in the mountains of El  
<br>Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia and Ecuador (Fig. 5).  
<br>Although information on altitudinal distribution is scant, this species has  
<br>not been found at low altitudes (less than 1,000 m) in the hot tropics. It has  
<br>been collected from 32 m (105 ft.) at Rosario, Sinaloa, Mexico, up to 7,100  
<br>ft. (2,164 m) near Nochixtlan, Oaxaca, Mexico; from 3,300 ft. (1,006 m) at  
<br>Santiago de Puriscal, Costa Rica, up to 9,000 ft. (2,743 m) on Volcan Irazu,  
<br>Costa Rica; 7,800 ft. (2,377 m) at Popayan, Colombia, and 2,800 m (9,184  
<br>ft.) at Calacali, Ecuador. A. leunculus has been collected in February and  
<br>October in Ecuador; February in Colombia; every month but January,  
<br>March, June and November in Central America; every month but January  
<br>and November in Mexico; and on March 31 near Pharr, Texas. Undoubtedly  
<br>this bee is more widely distributed altitudinally and seasonally than is in-  
<br>dicated by these records. I have seen fewer than 300 specimens, and this  
<br>sample is probably biased because bee collectors seldom work as high as  
<br>3,000 m and because most of the specimens were collected by North Ameri-  
<br>cans, who seldom have an opportunity to collect from October through May.  
<p>Diagnosis. The male may be differentiated from males of many other  
<br>species by its slender, untoothed hind femora and rounded lateral pronotal  
<br>angle; from A. nasutus by its normal clypeal region; from A. rhopalocera  
<br>by its normal antennae; from A. peninsidaris and A. mexicanns by its lack  
<br>of enlarged subapical hairs on metasomal sternum 4; and from A. melli-  
<br>ventris by the black on the basal portion of its metasomal tergum 1. The  
<br>female may be distinguished from other species with black metasoma and  
<br>green or coppery head and mesosoma by the prominent carina extending  
<br>postero-ventrally from the rounded lateral angle of its pronotum.  
<p>Variation. The coloration of the head and dorsal mesosomal region, as  
<br>well as the pubescence thereon, is quite variable in females of this species.  
<br>Most of the females are metallic green on the head and thorax. Some of the  
<br>females from Costa Rica (Volcan Irazu, San Jose, Cartago and San Mateo)  
<br>have reddish or coppery integument on the head and the dorsal mesosomal  
<br>area. The pubescence on these areas is orange. Although nowhere else so  
<br>extreme, I have seen females from Mexico (e.g., Orizaba, Vera Cruz;  
<br>Ajijic, Jalisco; Tehuacan, Puebla; and near Oaxaca, Oaxaca) with orange  
<br>pubescence and with coppery tints on the head and the dorsal mesosomal  
<br>area. In still other areas (e.g., near Ciudad del Maiz and San Luis Potosi)  
<br>the integument is green but the pubescence orange. In those regions where  
<br>the orange of the pubescence and the coppery color is most pronounced, the  
<br>yellow band on the clypeus of females is often reduced or absent. As these  
<br>regions are relatively cool and wet, it is not surprising that the females are  
more darkly pigmented. The pigmentation of the males is correlated with  
<br>that of the females. Those males with enlarged black or brown markings  
<br>are found with the darker females. As in the females, intergrades may be  
<br>found between the lightest and darkest males. It is the presnce of color  
<br>intergrades and the lack of structural differences that lead me to synonymize  
<br>A. leunciilus and A. nasutus ater. Some of the females from Costa Rica,  
<br>Colombia and Ecuador have fuliginous pubescence on the head and dorsal  
<br>mesosomal regions, but sympatric intermediates exist for this condition also.  
<br>The tegulae of those females with orange or fuliginous pubescence are  
<br>often dark brown to black, unlike the more common yellow and trans-  
<br>parent tegulae of females from warmer, drier areas.
