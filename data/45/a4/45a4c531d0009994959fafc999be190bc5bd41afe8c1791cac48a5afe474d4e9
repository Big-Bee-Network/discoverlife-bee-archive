<br> 
FLOWER RECORDS�According to LaBerge (1961) Helianthus is the primary source of pollen for coloradensis, but it has been recorded as visiting also species of the following: Cirsium, Coreopsis, Heliopsis, Liatris, Lythrum, Rudbeckia, Silphium, Solanum, Solidago, Verbena and Vernonia.

Extracted from: LaBerge, W. E., 1961. A Revision of the Bees of the Genus Melissodes in North and Central America. Part III (Hymenoptera, Apidae). The University of Kansas Science Bulletin, Vol. 43. 1-107. 
<P> 
This large, distinctively colored bee is readily distinguished from 
the other members of the subgenus Callimelissodes. It superficially 
resembles Svastra obliqua (Say), but can be separated from that 
species by the shape of the tegulae which are narrowed anteriorly 
as in all species of the genus Melissodes. M. coloradensis can be 
separated from other species of the subgenus Callimelissodes in both 
sexes by the deeply infumate wings, the yellow-ochre color of the 
pale vestiture, the coarsely punctate integument (although less 
coarse than in M. tuckeri) and its large size (equaled only by some 
specimens of M. glenwoodensis in this subgenus. It is most closely related to M. tuckeri than to any other members of the subgenus. 
<p> 
Female. Measurements and ratios: N, 20; length, 13-16 mm.; 
width, 4.5-6.0 mm.; wing length, M = 5.25   0.126 mm.; hooks in 
hamulus, M = 16.20   0.304; flagellar segment 1/segment 2, M = 
1.99   0.022. 
<p> 
Male. Measurements and ratios: N, 20; length, 13-16 mm.; 
width, 4.0-5.5 mm.; wing length, M = 4.88   0.240 mm.; hooks in 
hamulus, M = 15.05   0.198; flagellar segment 2/segment 1, M = 
6.40   0.103. 
<p> 
Structure and color: Integument black except as follows: disti- 
tarsi, apical half of mandible and lower surface of flagellar seg- 
ments 3 (often apex of 2) to 10 rufescent; wing membranes deeply 
infumate, brown; eyes dark gray to greenish gray. 
Clypeus with small round punctures separated mostly by half a 
puncture width or less, surface dulled by coarse reticular shagreen- 
ing; supraclypeal area similar to clypeus but punctures larger me- 
dially; vertex with flattened area posteromesad of compound eye 
with small round punctures separated by half to one puncture 
width, surface dulled by fine shagreening; eye about 3 times as 
long as broad; galeae dulled above by fine tessellation; maxillary 
palpal segments in ratio of about 2.5:3.0:2.0:1.0, last segment vari- 
able. Mesoscutum with deep round punctures separated by less 
than one-half to somewhat more than one puncture width, slightly 
more crowded anteriorly and laterally than posteromedially, sur- 
face shiny, with extremely delicate shagreening or unshagreened; 
scutellar punctures similar to mesoscutal but average slightly 
smaller; metanotal punctures half diameter of large scutellar punc- 
tures, crowded, mediodorsally separated by about half a puncture 
width, surface minutely tessellate; propodeum as in M. lupina but 
dorsal surface in apical half with punctures elongate and orientated 
anterolaterally; mesepisternum with punctures similar in size and 
spacing to anterior mesoscutal punctures, surface shiny. Metaso- 
mal tergum 1 with basal four-fifths punctate, punctures about same 
diameter as scutellar, smaller towards apical margin, separated by 
one-half to two puncture widths but mostly by less than one, apical 
area impunctate, surface dulled by extremely fine, dense, reticulo- 
transverse shagreening; tergum 2 with abundant deep punctures of 
same size as in tergum | or slightly smaller, in basal zone separated 
by half a puncture width or less, in interband zone separated mostly 
by one-half to one puncture width, in apical area crowded basally 
and becoming smaller and sparser apically until apical one-third of 
apical area impunctate, surface shagreened as in tergum 1; terga 
3 and 4 similar to tergum 2 but punctures slightly smaller and more 
crowded; pygidial plate U-shaped with arms diverging widely 
towards base. 
<p> 
Hair: Head ochraceous below to yellow-ochre above and vertex 
with abundant dark brown hairs. Thorax yellow-ochre laterally 
to slightly rufescent on anterior part of mesoscutum and pronotum; 
mesoscutal posteromedian dark brown patch extending laterally to 
tegulae or almost so and anteriorly to a transverse line at anterior 
margins of tegulae; tegulae dark brown; scutellum dark brown, 
narrowly fringed with ochraceous. Metasomal tergum 1 with long 
yellow-ochre hairs in basal third, apically with minute, simple, 
appressed, dark brown hairs; tergum 2 with pale ochraceous pu- 
bescence at extreme base, with narrow, short, lateral fasciae of 
ochraceous pubescence distally which equal less than one-third of 
tergum and in length about half of apubescent area apical to them, 
not connected with basal pubescence at extreme sides, interband 
and apical zones with short, closely appressed, simple, dark brown 
hairs; tergum 3 similar to tergum 2 except basal tomentum dark 
brown, lateral pale fasciae broader than one-third of width of 
tergum (occasionally with distal pale band only narrowly inter- 
rupted medially) and as long as or longer than apical apubescent 
area; tergum 4 similar to tergum 3 but distal pale band reaches 
apical margin except in median one-fourth to one-third, uninter- 
rupted medially; terga 5 and 6 dark brown except pale ochraceous 
tufts at sides; sternal hairs reddish brown medially to ochraceous 
laterally. Legs brown except as follows: coxae, trochanters and 
femora (except at tips) yellow-ochre to ochraceous; inner sur- 
faces of tarsi (including hind basitarsi) red to reddish brown; sco- 
pal hairs yellow except brown near apex of basitarsus and near 
basitibial plate. 
<p> 
Distribution. This species is distributed from North Carolina to 
California and from Wisconsin in the north to Arizona in the south 
(Fig. 4). It has been collected between the dates of July 2 and
