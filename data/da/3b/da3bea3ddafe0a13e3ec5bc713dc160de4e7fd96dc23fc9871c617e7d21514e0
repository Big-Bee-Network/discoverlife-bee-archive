This species seems to be closely related to both A. apacheorum and A. latinensis. All eight specimens have had the vestiture wetted and consequently some details are somewhat unclear. However, the metasomal apical fasciae are much wider than in both A apacheorum and A. latinensis, and terga 5 and 6 have the vestiture concolorous with that of terga 1 to 4.
