All six specimens are in very poor condition. The vestiture is matted because of wetting, but major characters are discernible nevertheless. A. latinensis seems to be close to A. apacheorum and A. rodilla, but is distinguished from these species by the angular roughening of the clypeus and the less well-defined metasomal apical fasciae.

Labial palpus with basal segment strongly compressed and twisted laterally, ultimate and penultimate segments moderately compressed laterally, ultimate segment attached subapically, segmental ratio 1.3:0.7:0.6:0.7. Labral process twice as wide as long, very strongly reflexed, tuberculate at angle, apical emargination depth half length of reflexed area. Clypeus weakly protuberant, extending below eyes for nearly half its length; small, lower, median area depressed, with large punctures separated on depressed area by 1 diameter, separated on remainder by one-half diameter or less, shiny.

Whole area with medium-sized punctures separated by 2 diameters; broad, median area heavily shagreened; remaining area more lightly shagreened except very narrow area near eye shiny. Vertex, supra-antennal area as in female except rugulae of supra-antennal area more prominent, punctures more obscure; parocular area as for supra-antennal area. 
<br><br>

Sternum 8 (fig. 19) with apex and neck region nearly 1.5 times as long as basal region, apex with shallow broad emargination, neck with abundant, long hairs. Gonoforceps (figs. 15 to 17) in dorsal view broad apically, with strong, oblique ridge reaching outer edge. Penis valves in dorsal and ventral view slightly wider medially than basally, apex weakly expanded; in lateral view penis turned sharply downwards at right angle, projecting well below gonoforceps. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Off-white throughout: Clypeus with surface obscured by long, white hair. Scutum, scutellum, with hair long, moderately dense. Metasomal tergum 1 with long, erect hairs on disc, not forming a definite apical fascia; terga 2 to 5 with poorly formed, apical fasciae of short, posteriorly directed hairs, fasciae present on more than one-third but less than one-half tergal area, not obscuring surface, remaining areas of discs with longer, more erect, moderately dense hairs. Sterna 1 to 6 with vestiture as in female except apical fringes very well developed on sterna 2 to 5, remaining hairs longer, more dense. 
<br><br> 
VARIATION. — In the two paratype females vein 1st m-cu meets the second submarginal cell beyond the middle. In the allotype male this vein in the right wing meets the second submarginal cell as in the paratype females, but in the left wing it meets the second submarginal cell just before the middle. Similar variation is found in the two paratype males. One paratype male has the clypeus more strongly depressed medially than in the other two specimens.
