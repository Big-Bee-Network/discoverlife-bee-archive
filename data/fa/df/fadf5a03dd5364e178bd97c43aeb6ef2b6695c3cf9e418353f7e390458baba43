<b>Overview</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Excerpted from Hall et al.  2016.  A new species of Colletes (Hymenoptera: Apoidea: Colletidae) from northern Florida and Georgia, with notes on the Colletes of those states. 
<p> 
Diagnosis: Both female and male of C. ultravalidus are distinguished from those 
of all other eastern North American species of the genus by their exceptionally long 
malar area, especially the male. This is a large bee with dense fulvous mesosomal 
pubescence, dark metasomal terga with apical fasciae absent or weak, and strongly 
infuscated wings. Color varies, and some specimens have paler pubescence. Colletes 
ultravalidus is most similar to, but somewhat larger than, C. validus Cresson (Figs. 2, 3). 
<p> 
The malar area exceeds in length that of C. validus, previously considered the Nearctic 
species with the longest malar area within the genus. The proportionately longer 
malar area comes at the expense of a proportionately shorter compound eye (Figs. 
4–11; Table 1). In contrast to C. ultravalidus, C. validus has pronounced apical fasciae on 
the metasomal terga, ochraceous rather than fulvous pubescence, most notable on the 
mesosoma, and lighter wings. Colletes ultravalidus tends to have more fuscous hairs 
intermixed with light hairs, for example on the legs of females. Colletes ultravalidus 
resembles C. thoracicus Smith, as both have abundant mesosomal fulvous pubescence, 
strongly infuscated wings, and lack metasomal fascia in females. However, both sexes 
of C. thoracicus are easily distinguished from C. ultravalidus by their much shorter malar 
area (less than half the width of the mandible base in females, subequal in males) and 
shorter clypeus. Females of C. thoracicus are slightly smaller and more slender, males 
more so. Three other species of Colletes in the eastern United States have notably long 
malar areas, C. longifacies Stephen, C. productus Robertson, and C. compactus Cresson. 
All have conspicuous tergal fascia, an average smaller body size than C. ultravalidus, 
and malar area not exceeding the width of the mandible at its base, thus much shorter 
than the malar area of either C. ultravalidus or C. validus. The S7 of C. ultravalidus and C. 
validus males have a nearly identical shape which separates them from other species of 
Colletes (Figs. 12, 13). Genital armatures of the two species differ subtly in the position 
of the dorsal wings (Figs. 14, 15). 
<p> 
Description: &#9792;: Structure. Body length 14.27±0.98 mm, inter-tegular distance 
3.62±0.05 mm (n=7) [13.37±0.55 mm and 3.17±0.17 mm (n=6), respectively, for C. validus]. 
Head 3.78± 0.18 mm long (n=7), length about 0.9x head width. Mandibles strongly 
crossed in ventral view, one extending nearly one-fifth its length beyond side of 
other. Clypeus, 0.44x head length, extends below mandible articulation by 0.5x length 
of malar area, strongly protuberant, with moderately deep median sulcus; apical margin 
with paired, variably shaped, depressions. Supraclypeal area strongly protuberant. 
Malar area about 0.31x length of head, 0.49x length of compound eye, almost 1.9x 
width of mandible base [0.25x, 0.37x, and 1.66x respectively for C. validus]. Vertex 
excavated lateral to ocelli. Antenna F2 about 0.8x length of F1, F2–F9 subequal in 
length, length subequal to width, F10 about 1.1x length of F1. Compound eye about 
0.57x length of head [0.63x for C. validus], inner margin subparallel (UOD/LOD ratio = 
0.99). Lateral ocelli slightly closer to each other than to compound eyes. Facial fovea 
short, wide, and shallow, lower margin about one-third distance from antenna to lateral 
ocellus, upper margin nearly level with lower margin of lateral ocellus. Facial fovea 
curves from inner orbital margin toward lateral ocellus, ending about half distance 
between these two. Genal area about 1.2x width of eye. Pronotal ridge with short, 
lateral angle, with wide base. Metapleural protuberance acarinate. Fore coxal spine 
lacking. First recurrent vein of forewing meets center of second submarginal cell. Pos- 
terior basitarsus 3.9x as long as broad. T1 slightly impressed narrow apical rim; T2–T5 
apical impressed area widens from about one fourth to one third of exposed surface 
of segment; S1 with narrow, central, rounded, elevated protuberance; S5 with wide, 
shallow, semicircular emargination. 
<p> 
Pubescence and Color. Integument nearly all black/piceous. Labrum and mandible 
with long, thick, erect, simple, fuscous hairs along ventral edge of mandible and 
apex of labrum, may be intermixed with few light hairs [pubescence all light in C. validus]. 
Lower paraocular area with sparse, short, ochraceous, plumose hairs intermixed 
with few, longer, fuscous, simple or somewhat branched hairs. Upper paraocular area 
and frons with dense, long, fulvous-brownish, plumose hairs intermixed with smaller 
number of fuscous hairs between and lateral to antennae, relatively bare between 
antennal base and vertex. Vertex with long, plumose fuscous hairs intermixed with 
shorter light hairs; more dense row of long light pubescence extending from upper 
occiput along upper margin of vertex. Genal area with sparse, long, fuscous, simple 
or somewhat branched hairs below and adjacent to compound eyes, mixed with long, 
fulvous, plumose pubescence above, more dense toward occipital ridge. Mesosoma 
with dense, light, fulvous hairs on pronotal lobe, as row along omaulus, on lateral 
mesoscutum anterior to wings, on metanotum, and on boundary between lateral and 
posterior surfaces of propodeum. Sparser, light, fulvous pubescence, intermixed with 
varying amounts of fuscous pubescence, on disc of mesoscutum [Stephen (1954) describes 
presence of abundant black pile on median discal areas of mesoscutum and 
mesoscutellum of C. validus, whereas these areas largely worn bare in both C. ultra- 
validus and C. validus specimens investigated here, with fulvous pubescence mainly 
on mesoscutum anteriorly and mostly long, erect, fuscous pubescence along posterior 
margin of mesoscutellum]. Mesepisternum with long, light pubescence, sparse below 
wings, more dense ventrally [distribution of hairs on mesepisternum of C. validus 
similar, but pubescence ochraceous to white versus light fulvous in C. ultravalidus]. 
Leg pubescence generally dark brown on basal segments, becoming dark brown or 
fuscous on distal segments [variable, three FSCA specimens with light leg pubescence; 
in C. validus light brown pubescence on basal segments, becoming ochraceous or white 
on distal segments]. Wings deeply infuscated [lightly infuscated in C. validus], veins 
and stigma piceous. T1 with fulvous hairs long and sparse on anterior declivitous 
surface, denser laterally; in some specimens fringe of pale ochraceous hairs along outermost 
lateral margin [hair distribution similar to that described by Stephen (1954) for 
C. validus, pubescence light ochraceous and less dense laterally]. Apical tergal fascia 
entirely or mostly absent, but better developed in some specimens with appressed, 
isolated, individual hairs or weak, fragmented, patches of tomentum along apical rim, 
sometimes more substantial laterally and across T4 and T5 rims [moderately wide 
and dense, apical fascia present in C. validus, interrupted medially, broadly on T1 narrowly 
on T2, entire on T3–T5; Stephen (1954) described sparse, long, erect, black pile 
on tergal discs of C. validus, whereas pile very short and light on discs of specimens 
examined]. Unworn specimens of C. ultravalidus have very sparse, short fuscous and 
light pubescence on tergal discs. T2–T5 pubescence erect, simple, light, short laterally, 
becoming sparser, darker, and longer from anterior to posterior; apical rims black or 
faint amber [impunctate tergal rims of C. validus noticeably amber where fascia has 
been lost]. T6 with dense, appressed, fuscous pubescence covering disc; erect, long, 
fuscous pubescence laterally. S1 protuberance with long fulvous hairs. S2–S5 with 
sparse fascia arising along basal margin of narrow, impressed, amber, apical rim; pubescence 
becoming denser, longer, lighter laterally; disc with appressed, short, sparse, 
light and sparse, erect, fuscous pubescence; light hairs of disc become increasingly 
longer, denser laterally. S6 with long, thick, appressed, fuscous hairs intermixed with 
fewer light hairs on disc.
