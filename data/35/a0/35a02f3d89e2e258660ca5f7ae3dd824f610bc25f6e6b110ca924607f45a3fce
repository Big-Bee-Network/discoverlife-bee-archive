<br><br> 
Andrena obscuripennis is a large dark-winged southeastern species closely related to A. dolomellea Lanham. The resemblance of these two species is so close that dolomellea may in the future be regarded as a subspecies of obscuripennis. However, because of differences in sculpture and morphology, especially of the propodeum and metasoma, the two should retain specific status until. additional evidence is available. Both sexes of obscuripennis can be separated from those of dolomellea by the more bulbous eyes, the dark integument, especially of the female clypeus and the metasomal terga, and the coarser metasomal punctation. The female of obscuripennis has the propodeal posterior surface sulcus linear rather than spindle-shaped. 
<br><br>

Tergum 7 with broad, dull, pygidial area with rounded apex. Sterna 2-5 sculptured at in vicina. Sternum 6 straight across apical margin not emarginate. 
<br><br> 
Terminalia as in figures 104-108; note sternum 7 with few apical hairs and rounded apical lobes and sternum 8 with apical lobe narrow, not expanded apically (much as in hilaris). 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Generally ochraceous but inner surfaces tarsi golden and terga 2-5 with at least some basal area hairs pale golden-brown. Form and distribution of hairs as in vicina; terga without pale apical fasciae. 
<br><br> 
Type Material. — The holotype female (BMNH 17a 13 89) was taken in Georgia. 
<br><br> 
Distribution. — Andrena obscuripennis is known only from Georgia and North Carolina (Fig. 11) Mitchell (1960) provisional ly includes New Jersey and Louisiana in the range of obscuripennis but no evidence for this has been seen by the present authors. In addition to the holotype, a total of 25 FF and 4 MM have been studied, all from North Carolina. Data for these specimens are given in full.

Extracted from Parys K, Griswold T, Ikerd H, Orr M (2018) New records and range extensions of several species of native bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea) from Mississippi. Biodiversity Data Journal 6: e25230.<P>The currently published distribution of this species is recognised as Florida, 
Georgia, North Carolina and Ontario [Canada] (Bouseman and LaBerge 1978, 
Pascarella and Hall 2013, Woodcock et al. 2014). Mitchell (1960) originally included 
New Jersey and Louisiana as part of the distribution, but those records could not be 
validated by Bouseman and LaBerge (1978). Additional records from coastal areas of 
South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland are available online (Ascher and Pickering 
2018). Little is known about the biology of this species, though in a study conducted in 
Georgia on the flight heights of bees, one individual was collected within 0.5 m of the 
ground while none were collected in the canopy (Ulyshen et al. 2010). 
<P>Of the three specimens reported here, all were female (Fig. 1). Two of the specimens 
were collected in Bolivar County at the Alcorn State University Research Farm located 
in Mound Bayou, MS. One of the specimens was collected in a blue vane trap while the 
other was netted from a fallow field. The third specimen was retrieved as bycatch from 
a baited Hartstack pheromone trap located in Coahoma County near Dublin, MS.
