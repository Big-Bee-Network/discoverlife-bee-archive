Extracted from Snelling R.R., (1966). Studies on North American Bees of the Genus Hylaeus. 1. Distribution of the Western Species of the Subgenus Prosopis With Descriptions of New Forms (Hymenoptera: Colletidae). Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History<p> 
<br>This is the common western species which has long been known as //. episcopalis (Cockerell). However, an examination of considerable material from the Rocky Mountain region and the western states indicates that H. episcopalis is best regarded as a subspecies of H. rugulosus. Both forms occur over large areas of the western states. The nominate form has a more northern distribution, but follows the Rocky Mountains south to New Mexico, and the Cascades and Sierra Nevada into montane central California, where it is common in the Transition and Boreal Zones. The periphery of its range broadly overlaps that of H. r. episcopalis and specimens from these overlapping areas are difficult to determine to subspecies.<p> 
<br>The situation is further complicated by the presence of three additional forms which arc structurally very similar to H. rugulosus. Because all of these are considered to intergrade with H. r. rugulosus and H. r. episcopalis they are here regarded as subspecies. One of these, H. r. gifjardiellus Cockerell, presents relatively few problems since its range is confined to the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California, and is thus the most prccinctive of the five subspecies currently recognized. In keeping with this restricted habitat, this subspecies intergrades only with the subspecies H. r. episcopalis in the surrounding foothill areas. <p> 
<br>Another subspecies, H. r. coquilletti (Cockerell), occurs throughout the Great Basin Region, south to Baja California, Mexico, thence eastward to western Texas. This form is a conspicuous member of the Lower Sonoran bee fauna of the southwestern area and is perhaps more nearly deserving of specific rank than any of the other forms. <p> 
<br><b>Hylaeus rugulosus mgtdosus (Cockerell), new status </b><p> 
<br>In this form the female clypeus is entirely black, the lateral face marks are frequently greatly reduced, never extending above the lower margin of the an-tennal sockets, the pronotal collar is entirely black or with no more than one-third of its dorsal surface yellow, and the front tibiae are entirely black or with a very small basal spot. The male has the pronotal collar as in the female, the lateral face marks ending at or slightly above the upper margin of the antennal sockets and the scape entirely black or slightly suffused with reddish on the underside. Both sexes have the wings distinctly and strongly suffused with brownish <p> 
<br>The nominate form is common throughout the northern portions of the range of the species, and in the southern areas is found in the Transition and Boreal Zones. Much of its distribution in the Transition overlaps that of the following subspecies and considerable intergradation occurs <p> 
<br>I have examined the type of H. universitatis Cockerell, which is now in the Timberlake collection at Riverside, California. The type, a male collected at Boulder, Colorado, by W. P. Cockerell on June 11, 1905, is not separable from typical H. rugulosus, and I have no hesitation in reducing it into the synonymy of that species.<p> 
<br><b> Hylaeus rugulosus giffardiellus Cockerell, new status. </b><p> 
<br>This is the most highly precinctive form of the species, being restricted to the Lower Sonoran Zone in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Valleys of California. It differs from H. r. episcopalis, with which it intergrades in the marginal foothills, by having the lateral face marks extending well above the upper margin of the antennal sockets; the apical one-third to one-half of the clypeus strongly marked with reddish; clypeus frequently with small yellow preapical spot; at least three-fourths of the dorsal surface of the pronotum yellow; the stripe on the front tibiae extending one-half the length of the tibiae. In the male the face marks are more extensive, the pronotal collar is as in the female, and the scape is conspicuously maculate. In both sexes the maculae are bright lemon-yellow <p> 
<br><b>Hylaeus rugulosus coquilletti (Cockerell), new status</b> <p> 
<br>Hylaeus r. coquilletti is the most highly maculate form of the species and certainly the most distinctive. Superficially it bears a strong resemblance to the preceding but differs at once in the paler maculae which are cream-color rather than bright lemon-yellow. The female frequently has a pale preapical spot on the clypeus, the posterior basitarsi usually have a small basal macula (entirely black in the other forms), and the pubescence of the third and fourth tergites is entirely pale, that of the third no sparser on the disc than laterally. In the male the lateral face marks extend nearly to the tops of the eyes and the abdominal pubescence is pale. <p> 
<br><b> Hylaeus (Prosopis) rugulosus metzi, new subspecies </b> <p> 
<br>This is the form common in cismontane southern California which has long been known as H. episcopalis (Cockerell), a form now recognized as a subspecies of H. rugulosus (Cockerell). The two are similar in distribution of maculae, but differ in certain details of pubescence and sculpture. <p> 
<br>This subspecies is named for Charles W. Metz who published a revision of the Nearctic species of this genus in 1911, and whose work has been a constant reference for the present study.<p> 
<br><I>Female </I>: Structurally similar to nominate and other forms. Integument black, the following pale yellowish: paraocular areas, extending up along inner orbits ending a little above level of upper margin of antennal sockets; stripe of variable size, interrupted medially, on pronotal collar; pronotal tubercules largely; spot on tegulae; basal spot on fore and middle tibiae; basal one-fifth to one-fourth of hind tibiae. Pubescence of head, thorax and legs pale; of tergites I-III pale; of tergite IV, pale, with intermixed fuscous hairs; of tergites V and VI, largely fuscous. Erect pubescence of tergites III-VI longer and notably denser than in other subspecies. Punctures of mesopleurae a little coarser and less contiguous than in H. r. rugulosus, integument less densely tessellate than in H. r. episcopalis. Punctures of tergite I sparser and finer than those of tergite II; of tergite II separated by a puncture diameter or less; tergites III and IV with large, poorly defined subcontiguous punctures. <p> 
<br><I>Male </I>: Structurally similar to nominate and other forms. Integument black, the following pale yellowish to cream color: elongate spot on mandibles; clypeus; large supraclypeal spot; paraocular areas, extending up along inner eye margin to slightly above level of upper margin of antennal sockets; thoracic maculae as in female; outer surface of fore tibiae, basal spot on middle tibiae, basal one-fourth to one-third of hind tibiae, hind basitarsi. Underside of scape and flagel-lum, fore and middle tarsi entirely, hind medio- and distitarsi all dull ferruginous to ferruginous-yellow. Pubescence similar to that of female. Thoracic and abdominal punctation similar to that of male of H. r. coquilletti.<p>
