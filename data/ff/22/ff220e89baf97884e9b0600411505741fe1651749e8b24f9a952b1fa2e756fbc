This colorful bee from Mexico and Central America was considered by T. D. A. Cockerell (1898) to be allied to species now placed in the subgenus Plastandrena, which it resembles superficially in color. However, judging from the descriptions given by Smith (1879) and Cockerell (1906), A. discreta is most likely identified as a Callandrena of a rather unusual type. The female is distinctive in the more or less red integument, the triangular, sharply pointed, labral process, the usually red hind basitarsi, the ochraceous to brown scopal hairs and the usually ferruginous tergal vestiture. The male usually has the integument more or less red, the labral process triangular (although with the apex blunted and minutely emarginate), usually red hind tarsi and more or less ferruginous tergal vestiture. A. discreta is distinguished from allied species described below by usually having sternum 6 with a small subconical tubercle in both sexes.

<br><br> 
Genitalia and sterna 7 and 8 (Figs. 312-315) as figured. Note the following: narrow type of penis valves; dorsal lobes gonocoxites extremely long. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. � Generally ochraceous to fox-red. Tergal vestiture as in female; sterna 2-5 without clear subapical fimbriae; tibiae and basitarsi in dark forms with reddish-brown hairs. 
<br><br> 
TYPE MATERIAL. � The female holotype from Mexico is in the coition of the British Museum (Natural History), London, England.  
DISTRIBUTION. � A. discreta is known to occur throughout Mexico from Chiapas to Durango and in Costa Rica. It has been collected from August 2nd through February 16th. Thirteen females and 18 males have been examined from the following localities: Mexico. CHIAPAS: San Cristobal las Casas. DURANGO: Palos Colorados, GUANAJUATO: Panajachel (8 miles S.E.). HIDALGO: Tulancingo (6 miles W.). PUEBLA: Amecameca; Huachinango (8 miles W.); Puebla. SAN LUIS POTOSI: Tamazunchale. TLAXCALA: Apizaco (10 miles N.). VERACRUZ; Coscomatepec; Jalapa; Orizaba. Costa Rica. Monteverde. 
<br><br> 
REMARKS. � Specimens from eastern Mexico, that is, the state of Veracruz, tend to be darker in color than those from elsewhere. An eastern subspecies might be recognized in the future when larger samples of the populations of this bee become available. 
<br><br> 
The single female collected at Monteverde, Costa Rica, February 16, 1963, by C. W. and M. E. Rettenmeyer is remarkable in its dark vestiture. In general this female is like the dark females from the state of Veracruz in Mexico but the head hairs, most of the dorsal thoracic hairs and the abdominal hairs are dark brown. In addition, the tergal apices are translucent, smoky brown. This female appears to be an extreme variant of A. discreta. However, it is considerably out of the range of the remainder of the available material and elected at a time of year when discreta is unknown from Mexico. The true status of this female must await additional material from Mexico, Costa Rica and intervening areas.
