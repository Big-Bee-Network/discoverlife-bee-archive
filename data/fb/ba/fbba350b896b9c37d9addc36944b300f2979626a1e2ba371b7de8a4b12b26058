HOST RECORDS. Coelioxys juner¬aria has been reported from more hosts than any other North American Coelioxys. Graenicher (1927) reported C. juneraria to be a parasite of Megachile latimanus. Medler (1958) reported C. juneraria from the nest of M. inermis, and Medler and Koerber (1958) reported C. juneraria from the nest of M. relativa. Mitchell (1962) listed M. jrigida as a host of C. juneraria, and Hobbs (1968) found a fifth host species, M. rotundata 
<P> 
DISTRIBUTION AND SEASON OF FLIGHT. The distribution of Coelioxys juneraria extends from above the arctic circle to southern New Mexico (Fig. 20). Such a broad distribution, however, is no more remarkable than the distribution of one of the host bees, Megachile jrigida, which ranges from Alaska to Arizona. 
<P> 
HABITAT. In the northern portion of its range, Coelioxys juneraria is associ¬ated with areas designated as various co-niferous forests, tundra-coniferous forest, northeastern oak-pine forests, northern floodplain forests, Appalachian oak forest, northern grassland, oak savana, and fescue-wheatgrass vegetation types. Further south C. juneraria is associated only with vege¬tation types which occur at higher eleva¬tions such as alpine meadow barrens in Colorado and southwestern spruce-fir for¬est in New Mexico. In California (Gil-roy), C. juneraria was taken near an area classified as the ecotone between California oakwoods and fescue-oatgrass vegetation types. 
<P> 
GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION. Al¬though there is considerable variation in size in Coelioxys juneraria, larger and smaller specimens occur throughout the range. One explanation for such variation may be that its size is an expression of host size. The large bees may utilize the nests of Megachile inermis (15-22 mm). Medium sized C. juneraria may utilize the nests of M. jrigida (12-15 mm) and M. latimanus (13-14 mm), and the small C. juneraria may utilize the nests of M. rela¬tiva (9-12 mm) and M. rotundata (8-9 mm). The distributions of the host bees overlap over thousands of square miles, and perhaps this overlap accounts for the considerable variation within and between populations of C. juneraria from any one area.
