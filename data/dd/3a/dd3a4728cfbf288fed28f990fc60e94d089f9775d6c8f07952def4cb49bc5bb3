Extracted by H. E Milliron. A Monograph of the Western Hemisphere Bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae; Bombinae) II. The Genus Megabombus Subgenus Megabombus. The Entomological Society of Canada, Ottawa 1970. pp. 239-330. <p> 
<br>Description. Queen. Length, 24.0 mm; width at wing bases, 11.0 mm; abdomen, 12.0 mm, width across T2, 12.0 mm; front wing length, 19.0 mm, width, 6.5 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, the temples rather angulately rounded, the vertex very weakly arcuate across, its median height slightly less than the widest part; vertical region shallowly and unevenly concave, for the most part covered with small (follicular) punctures, rather strongly inclined toward the occiput; most of the ocellocular area bearing small to medium sparse punctures; compound eyes only a little more broadly rounded below than above, their inner margins mostly subparallel except evenly incurved above; ocelli large and located in a weak arc much closer together than their diameters and considerably below the supraorbital line; interocellar line nearly If times longer than the ocellocular line; malar space about equal to distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, virtually smooth and nearly flat; labrum rather densely pubescent, about twice as wide as thick, its ventral margin arcuate, the shelf neither strong nor sharp, the tubercles rather coarsely punctate, their mesal summits separated about the length of FI by a rather deep intertubercular depression; flagellum If times longer than scape, FI almost subequal to the combined lengths of F2 and F3, the latter being about If times longer than F2; clypeus a little wider near base than its median height, for the most part evenly and moderately strongly convex, the center with relatively few small punctures. Legs: Mesobasitarsite subrectangular, about 4 times longer than its widest part which is as wide as the longest hairs of the posterior fringe, its outer surface nearly flat, the distal angles about equally sharp and extended with a shallow emargination between; outer hind tibial surface granulose with a mid-longitudinal convexity, the widest part little less than the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; outer surface of metabasitarsite broadly concave longitudinally, the posterior margin weakly arcuate near base of segment becoming nearly straight to distal end, the widest part approxi­ mately 2i times as wide as the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the acutely rounded distoposterior angle extended considerably beyond the blunter right angled disto- anterior one with only a shallow emargination between. Pubescence: On head and most of thorax rather short, even, fine and dense, that on most of scutellum and abdomen longer, looser and rather uneven; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe moderately long along proximal two- thirds of segment, gradually becoming very short distally, the hairs straight, not especially dense; corbicular fringe composed of rather long mostly straight hairs except distal ones arcuate, not especially dense; metabasitarsal posterior fringe short, longest basally becoming gradually shorter to very short distally, not dense, most of the hairs only weakly arcuate. Color: Head black, the pile on the occiput with a slight coppery tinge; thorax black except pronotum and mesonotum anteriad of tegulae with a conspicuous intermixture of cinereous pile, that on the disc with a slight coppery tinge evident under certain light; legs black; abdomen black except many (if not most) of the hairs on the distal terga (especially T5-6) are pale or pale (whitish) tipped. Wings rather uniformly and moderately infuscated with brownish black.<p> 
Worker. Length, 15.0 mm; width at wing bases, 8.0 mm; abdomen, 7.0 mm, width across T2, 7.0 mm; front wing length, 13.0 mm, width, 4.0 mm. The more diminutive diagnostic features are proportionately similar to those of the queen except the ocelli are situated a little closer to the supraorbital line, and the clypeus often has a few well separated medium punctures. Color: Like that of the queen except there is usually considerable inter­ mixture of cinereous pile on the face and often some on the scutellum; the dark pile with coppery tinge is usually restricted to the occiput (and sometimes the gena) if it is evident at all. Infuscation of wings like that of the queen.<p> 
Male. Length, 17.5 mm; width at wing bases, 7.0 mm; abdomen, 8.5 mm, width across T2, 7.5 mm; front wing length, 14.0 mm, width, 4.5 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) roundly trapezoidal, the narrow temples rather evenly rounded, the vertex nearly transversely flat, the median height nearly equal to the widest dimension; vertical region nearly flat, largely covered with small (follicular) punctures, at most very weakly inclined toward the occiput; ocelli large, situated much closer together than their diameters and far below the supraorbital line; ocellocular area very narrow, equalling only about i of the diameter of an ocellus, traversed by a ridge adjacent to compound eye and with only a few inconspicuous punctures; interocellar line more than twice that of the ocellocular line; compound eyes swollen, more broadly rounded above than below, their inner margins subparallel and nearly straight; malar space nearly f as long as distance between (and including) mandibular articu­ lations, weakly convex and with only microscopic punctations; labrum almost 3 times as wide as its median thickness, mostly smooth and shiny with only a few punctures, the ventral margin nearly straight except arcuate at the lateral corners, the callosities very weak and poorly defined; flagellum 3 times longer than scape, FI only slightly shorter (if any) than F3 which is nearly li times longer than rectangular F2. Legs: Mesobasitarsite narrow elongate-sub- rectangular, at least 4 times longer than its widest part which is about equal to i the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the outer surface broadly and shallowly concave to nearly flat, the distoposterior angle obtuse and considerably in recess of the blunt distoanterior angle without any definite emargination between; hind tibial outer surface microscopically granulose, longitudinally convex for the most part, moderately pubescent, the widest part about f the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite with outer surface shallowly concave longitudinally, not quite 4 times longer than widest 
part which is about 1 that of the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the posterior margin nearly straight along its basal half beyond weakly arcuate, the distal angles about equally extended, the distoposterior one rather rounded, only a shallow emargination between. Pubescence: Fine, rather dense, short and even on most of thorax, that on vertex, scutellum, and abdomen (especially the distal terga) considerably longer; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe moderately long and dense, most hairs straight or nearly so the distal ones short; hind tibial posterior fringe long except short basally, not dense, most hairs straight except those distally are arcuate; metabasitarsal posterior fringe long and loose except short distally, most hairs weakly arcuate. Genitalia and seventh and eighth abdominal sterna (PL XIX). Color: Face predominantly dull yellowish intermixed with some black hairs, remainder of head black (or blackish) with some dull yellowish on vertex and genae; thorax black (blackish) with a notice­ able amount of dull yellowish on the mesonotum anteriad of tegulae and a slight indication of the same color on the scutellum and mesopleuron; abdomen black with some pale (dull whitish) pile on the distal half of T5, this pale pile largely (to completely) covering T6-7. Wings about like those described for the queen though often noticeably paler.<p> 
Comments. This species is closely related to P. (C.) melaleucus (Handl.) from which it is not always easy to distinguish. Little significant morphological variation has been noted in this species. Chromatically the females are not very variable except for the amount of pale (whitish) pile on the distal abdominal terga; the male, however, does vary widely from the more common dark form used in the foregoing redescription to a lighter more colorful form referred to beyond; all inter­ gradations occur. The dark form might easily be confused with the male of P. (C.) volucelloides (Grib.) or be mistaken to be that of melaleucus, whereas the lighter forms might be taken to be the male of P. (C.) ecuadorius (Meun.).<P> 
The light forms might have considerable drab yellow on the head, thoracic dorsum, and over virtually all of abdominal Tl, grading to individuals having a brighter yellow on most of the head and thorax with only a scant intermixture of black hairs especially on the thoracic dorsum, and have all of abdominal Tl and also T2 covered with yellow, the latter tergum sometimes at least partially tinged with ferruginous, or have some intermixture of black on other terga.
