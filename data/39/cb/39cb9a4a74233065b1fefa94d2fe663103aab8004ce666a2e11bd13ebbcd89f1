Andrena vandykei (male) and solutula (female) were described in the same paper (Cockerell, 1936). Even though the name solutula has precedence of position in the work I choose the name vandykei for this species. This action is taken because the male is more easily distinguished than the female (see Recommendation 24A, International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, 1964). It also seems desirable to retain in use a patronymic name for a famous entomologist (E. C. Van Dyke). 
<br><br> 
Andrena vandykei is a dark, wide-headed bee with a large pterostigma. The male can be distinguished by the deep suture extending below the humeral angle nearly to the anterior margin of the pronotum. This suture is often present to a lesser extent in the female. The propodeal corbicula lacks long hairs along the anterior margin and the apical abdominal fasciae are weak or absent. 
<br><br> 
The descriptions below are based mainly upon a female (April 17, 1961) and a male (March 11, 1959) collected at Alpine Lake, Marin County, California, by J. Powell. A total of 215 specimens of vandykei were examined during this study. 
<br><br>

Supraclypeal area with large punctures, partly obscured by reticular shagreening. Genal area in later view half again as wide as eye, posteriorly coming to a rounded point, large fingerlike projection at base of mandible, surface with fine, widely spaced, reticular shagreening. Vertex much elevated along posterior margin behind ocelli, extending past lateral ocellus by much more than one ocellar distance; entire vertex and face above antennal fossae with coarse, close, reticular shagreening; punctures indistinct; frontal line distinct, running from middle ocellus to supraclypeal area, lower half carinate. 
<br><br> 
Pronotum with strong humeral angle; suture extending vertically from leg base, lying in deep, wide sulcus, suture turning anteriorly below humeral angle and extending to anterior margin of pronotum; surface of pronotum with reticular shagreening. Mesoscutum, tegula, scutellum and metanotum as in female. Propodeum as in female except propodeum narrower, enclosure sloping posteriorly (approaching the condition found in Hesperandrena), lateral area with coarser shagreening. Mes- and metepisterna as in female. Wings, claws and tibial spurs as in female. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga as in female except tergum 7 exposed, pointed; pygidial plate absent. Exposed sterna as in female except sternum 6 with apical margin flexed greatly downward medially. 
<br><br> 
Sternum 7 slightly emarginate and shagreened at apex, producing two lobes, each bearing several setae (fig. 93). Sternum 8 with apical half convex, base expanded into large, long plate (fig. 94); apex slightly expanded, weakly emarginate; shaft short, bent downward and then posteriorly; sternum with apical half setose, some setae branched, some setae reaching considerably beyond apex. Gonocoxite slender, bent downward; gonoforceps expanded near middle, dorsal surface with several branched setae; dorsal lobes wide, short. Penis valve bent downward, apex slender, only slightly expanded medially (figs. 90-92). 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — Hairs white except some chocolate brown hairs on head and thorax. Otherwise hairs as in female except hairs mostly longer, fringe of long hairs along ventral margin of clypeus, facial fovea absent, apical abdominal fasciae entirely absent, tergum 7 with longitudinal bare area, sternal hairs more plumose basad of subapical fimbriae, hairs specialized for pollen collecting absent. 
<br><br> 
VARIATION. — There is considerable variation in the male terminalia. Sternum 7 varies from deeply notched to truncate at the apex, and the shape of the apical lobes is highly variable. Sternum 8 may or may not be expanded at the apex, the apical emargination is sometimes lacking, and the basal plate varies in shape. Basally the penis valve may be wider or narrower than shown in figure 91 and the apex of the penis valve in side view is often wider (fig. 92). The tip of the gonostylus may be bent inward in dorsal view and the inner lobe of the volsella can be much reduced. Although these variations in the male terminalia are often striking, the terminalia exhibit much the same basic structure. The variation in this basic structure is such that of the specimens dissected no two were the same in the characters discussed above. There does not seem to be any correspondence between variation in terminalia and external morphology; externally the males are very similar. If there is any north-south geographic variation in the terminalia it is slight and masked by individual and populational variation. 
<br><br> 
The male clypeus may lack the yellow maculation that is usually present. Male size varies considerably (4.3 to 5.9 mm, wing length from tegula); much of this variation can be found at a single locality. A single female is as small as the smallest male (on the basis of wing length). There are a few other females approaching this small size, however, in general the females are more constant in size than the males. A few females have distinct but weak apical fasciae on abdominal terga 2-4, but usually the fasciae are indistinct as in the female description. The female pterostigmata occasionally may be slightly smaller than in the description. The female humeral angle and the suture extending anteriorly below it may be weak at times (this character and the presence of apical fasciae are typical of, but not restricted to, specimens from the Sierra Nevada Mountains). The female clypeus may be covered with distinct reticular shagreening, but more commonly it has weak shagreening in the center.
