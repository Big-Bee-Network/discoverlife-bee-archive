This species is very close to A. aurihirta, but it is a little smaller, especially in the males, and can be distinguished by the clypeus being more protuberant and nearly naked in the lower median area, the propodeal enclosure without a longitudinal, median depression, and the lateral areas of metasomal tergum 2 anteriorly to the apical fascia with all hairs short and appressed. A. citrinihirta is found in the Central Valley of California and as far north as southern Oregon, and A. aurihirta is found in the Santa Barbara Mountains of southern California, north to the Tehachapi Mountains, and for a short distance north of the Tehachapis along the Sierra Nevada. The two species are allopatric but nearly meet in the Tehachapi region (map 11). An original parent population probably extended throughout California, but may have been exterminated in the Sierra by climatic changes, with two populations surviving in refuges, one in the San Francisco Bay area and one in the higher, non-glaciated areas of southern California. Amelioration of the climate since the last Ice Age would have permitted the two now distinct species to reinvade much of the former range and to almost meet in at least one area. These two species are separable from other species in the Citrinihirta group by their citrus yellow vestiture. Metasomal vestiture links these two species to both A. ramaleyi and A. sulcata, and more distantly to A. bendensis.
