This species is similar to A. surda, but the vestiture is citrus yellow throughout; it is much larger than A. citrinihirta or A. aurihirta, the two other species with citrus yellow vestiture, and the wings are much darker apically. The male of A. luteihirta is very similar to the male of A. surda, and, with the like similarity between the females of these two species, suggests that the relationship of these species is close. Andrena surda is widely distributed in about the western half of North America except for Southern California and areas west of the Sierra Nevada, and it is in these areas that A. luteihirta is found. This distributional pattern suggests that one population originally inhabited both areas, and the west coast population was reproductively isolated from the remainder, probably by climate change. Independent evolution and reinvasion of areas has probably led to the present species distinction and distribution.
