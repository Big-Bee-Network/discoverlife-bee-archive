Extracted by H. E Milliron. A Monograph of the Western Hemisphere Bumblebees (Hymenoptera: Apidae; Bombinae) II. The Genus Megabombus Subgenus Megabombus. The Entomological Society of Canada, Ottawa 1970. pp. 239-330. <p> 
Description. Queen. Length, 27.0 mm; width at wing bases, 12.0 mm; abdomen, 14.0 mm; width across T2, 13.0 mm; front wing length, 20.0 mm, width, 7.0 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) trapezoidal, the median height a little greater than widest dimension, temples rather sharply rounded, the vertex transversely at most only weakly arcuate; vertical region flattened and only slightly inclined toward the occiput; ocel- locular area with some small punctures medially, otherwise smooth; compound eyes notice­ ably more broadly and evenly rounded below than above, their inner margins weakly incurved and subparallel; ocelli of medium size, situated distinctly closer together than their diameters and in a weak arc just below the supraorbital line; interocellar and ocellocular lines nearly equal; malar space perceptibly a little longer than distance between (and including) man­ dibular articulations, the outer surface with only a few small irregular punctures and having a shallow transverse depression; labrum little more than twice as wide as its median thickness, with a wide but not sharp arcuate labral shelf located near the ventral margin which is mostly broadly arcuate, the blunt tubercles irregularly punctate and not separated by a wide deep intertubercular depression; flagellum slightly more than If times longer than scape, FI about f as long as the combined lengths of rectangular F2 and F3, the latter nearly If times longer than F2; clypeus for the most part rather evenly but not strongly convex, well covered with mostly small shallow punctures, the widest part near base about f wider than the median height. Legs: Mesobasitarsite subrectangular, slightly more than 3f times longer than widest part which is about If times wider than the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe near the base, the outer surface nearly flat, the distal end almost truncate with more or less rounded angles; hind tibia with the outer surface mostly microscopically granulose, somewhat irregularly flattened and without any pronounced longitudinal convexity, the widest part of segment equal to the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite sub- rectangular, the outer surface for the most part shallowly concave longitudinally, the widest part of segment at least 4 times wider than the length of longest hairs along the posterior margin which is rather evenly but weakly arcuate throughout, the distal end of segment subtruncate, its angles not sharp. Pubescence: Fine, dense, rather even except longer on vertical region of head, posteriorly on the scutellum and on abdominal T4-5, sparse along middle of Tl-5; mesobasitarsal posterior fringe short, dense, composed mostly of straight hairs except some near base are somewhat longer and slightly bent, outer surface of segment densely pubescent; metabasitarsal posterior fringe very short, moderately dense, with only a few slightly longer weakly arcuate hairs along the proximal half of margin. Color: Head mostly brownish black, the face with noticeable amount of fine short orange-yellow intermixed with the dark and the occiput with considerable pale reddish orange; thorax reddish orange, the dorsum intermixed with black which predominates on disc especially between the wings; legs mostly pale reddish orange; abdomen reddish orange with not well defined patches with a brownish tinge just laterad of center on T2-3, T4-6 and venter somewhat paler. Wings uniformly stained with brown, having a violaceous reflection under certain lights.<P> 
<br>Worker. Length, 14.0 mm; width at wing bases, 7.5 mm; abdomen, 7.0 mm, width across T2, 7.5 mm; front wing length, 12.0 mm, width, 4.5 mm. Structural characteristics and other features are, in comparison, very similar to those of the queen. Color: Head most often black but sometimes with an intermixture of pale pile on the face; thoracic pleura and venter dull (tawny) yellow (with a faint ferruginous tinge), the dorsum with a mixture of brownish black (or black) and pale (yellowish) the former color often predominant or completely dominant; legs mostly tawny yellow, the hind tibial fringes often with a distinct ferruginous tinge; abdominal T1 usually reddish orange but might be yellow with a ferruginous tinge, T2-3 usually covered with an uneven mixture of brownish black (or black) and reddish orange or yellow with the dark pile often predominant to completely dominant, T4-6 reddish orange but sometimes pale or yellowish. Wings somewhat less deeply infumated with brown than those of the queen. 
<p> 
Male. Length, 17.0 mm; width at wing bases, 8.0 mm; abdomen, 8.0 mm, width across T2, 8.5 mm; front wing length, 14.0 mm, width 5.0 mm. Head: Frontal outline (excluding mouthparts) rather narrowly trapezoidal, the widest part about equal to median height, the very narrow temples rather abruptly rounded, the vertex transversely weakly arcuate to nearly straight; vertical region nearly flat, for the most part covered with small (follicular) punctures, slightly inclined toward the occiput; ocelli medium in size, situated distinctly closer together than their diameters in a very weak arc well below the supraorbital line; ocellocular area with only a few medium punctures near eye margin; interocellar line little more than twice as long as the ocellocular line; compound eyes somewhat bulging, slightly more broadly rounded above than below, their inner margins nearly straight and divergent below; malar space about as long as distance between (and including) mandibular articulations, the outer surface nearly flat and with only a few minute punctures; labrum little more than twice as wide as its median thickness, transversely narrowly concave just above ventral margin which is weakly emarginate medially, the corners rounded, the callosities poorly defined and not prominent; clypeus rather evenly convex, not especially densely pubescent and rather evenly covered with numerous small irregular punctures; flagellum 3£ times longer than scape, FI distinctly longer than rectangular F3 and equal to about f the combined lengths of F2 and F3, the latter at least } longer than subrectangular F2. Legs: Mesobasitarsite elongate-subrectangular, 4 times longer than the widest part which is about I as wide as the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the outer surface mostly longitudinally concave posteriad of middle the remainder of surface flat, the distal angles both blunt and with only a shallow emargination between, the distoanterior one slightly extended; outer surface of hind tibia moderately convex, microscopically granulose and rather densely covered with fine hairs except medially on the distal third, the widest part of segment about equal to f the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe; metabasitarsite nearly rectangular, its outer surface broadly and shallowly concave longitudinally, the widest part of segment about equal to the length of longest hairs of the posterior fringe, the distal end subtruncate, the posterior margin very weakly evenly arcuate. Pubescence: Of medium length, fine, rather dense and even except a little longer and looser on vertical region, scutellum, abdominal T4-7, and most of the abdominal venter; meso- basitarsal posterior fringe not dense, most hairs straight or nearly so, longest on proximal half of margin gradually becoming very short and sparse distally; hind tibial posterior fringe rather dense, composed of straight hairs that are short proximally and rather suddenly becoming long along about the remaining four-fifths of the margin; metabasitarsal posterior fringe similar to that of the mesobasitarsite except distally it is somewhat denser. Genitalia and seventh and eighth abdominal sterna (PI. XIX). Color: The color pattern throughout on most males is very much like that of a typical worker, including varying amounts of dark (brownish black to black) appearing on abdominal T2-3, but the pattern of a few males is exactly like that of the queen. Wings colored very much like that of the worker, sometimes slightly less deeply stained.<p> 
Comments. No structural variability in this taxon that would lead to difficulties in recognizing all castes of this distinctive species was detected. The chromatic variation where evident within each caste has been indicated at various places in the redescription.
