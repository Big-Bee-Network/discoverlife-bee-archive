The vestiture is light yellow throughout, and the vestiture of the metasoma, particularly that of tergum 2, places this species within the Citrinihirta group. However, the species is readily distinguished from all other Cnemidandrena by the deep, transverse depression posterior to the gradulus on metasomal terga 2 to 5.

Penis valves in dorsal and ventral view slightly expanded medially, median width equal to basal width; in lateral view downturned apically, as long as gonoforceps. 
<br><br> 
VESTITURE. — White-yellow throughout. Clypeus with dense pubescence obscuring surface. Mesosoma dorsally as in female. 
<br><br> 
Metasomal terga 1 to 5 with well-developed, apical fasciae obscuring more than half terga.

Sternum 1 with sparse, long, erect hairs throughout, sterna 2 to 5 with strongly developed, apical fringes, remaining areas of sterna 2 to 6 with sparse, erect hairs. 
<br><br> 
VARIATION. — The propodeal enclosure varies in the degree of expression of the median longitudinal depression. In the holotype female from Ritzville, Adams Co., Washington, the depression is well developed with a carina anteriorly. One female from Wenatchee, Chelan Co., Washington, also has a short carina as in the female holotype, but another female from the same locality has a carina but the depression poorly developed, and another female from the same locality has the carina absent and the depression almost absent. The hair patterns on terga 1 and 2 are very similar in all female specimens, but the development of the tergal and sternal depressions varies somewhat. In males the sculpturing of the propodeal enclosure varies less than in females, but one male from Burntfork, Sweetwater Co., Wyoming, has the propodeal enclosure irregularly rugulate almost throughout and no obvious, median, longitudinal depression.
