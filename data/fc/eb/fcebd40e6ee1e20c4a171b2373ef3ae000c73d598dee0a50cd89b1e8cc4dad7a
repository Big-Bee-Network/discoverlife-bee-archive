Extracted from: Rightmyer MG, Deyrup M, Ascher JS, Griswold T (2011) Osmia species (Hymenoptera, Megachilidae) from the southeastern United States with modified facial hairs: taxonomy, host plants, and conservation status. In: Engel MS (Ed) Contributions Celebrating Kumar Krishna. ZooKeys 148: 257–278. doi: 10.3897/zookeys.148.1497 
<P> Diagnosis. Females of O. calaminthae are most similar to O. (Melanosmia) albiventris Cresson and O. (Melanosmia) cordata Robertson, sharing with those species the white hairs of the body (including scopa) and four-toothed mandible with the outer and condylar ridges parallel (Figs 13, 14). Unlike those species, O. calaminthae has specialized hairs on the face (including clypeus and frons) that are extremely short, evenly spaced, simple, and stout (Figs 5, 6; longer and finer in O. albiventris and O. cordata). 
In addition, the punctures of the head and mesosoma are large and deeply impressed 
in O. calaminthae, the hairs on the posterior surface of the foretarsal segments are 
relatively long, the wings are heavily infuscate, the rugose sculpturing of the dorsal 
propodeal triangle is strongly impressed and well differentiated from the ventral area 
of shagreened integument (Fig. 15), and the hairs on the lateral dorsal surface of T1 
are dense and long, much more so than on remaining metasomal terga (Figs 9, 10; T1 
hairs not conspicuously longer and denser than those on other metasomal terga in O. 
albiventris and O. cordata). Osmia (Melanosmia) sandhouseae Mitchell is a superficially 
similar species found sympatrically in Florida and is known to visit Calamintha in 
March (Deyrup et al. 2002); however, in that species the outer and condylar ridges of 
the mandible converge apically (parallel in O. calaminthae) and the hairs of the clypeus 
and frons are long and fine.<P> Males of O. calaminthae are distinguished from many other Osmia by the relatively 
slender, pointed teeth of T7 (basally about one-fourth the width of the midapical 
emargination; Fig. 22). Among the Osmia with such slender teeth on T7, O. calaminthae 
is extremely similar to O. cordata due to the white hairs on the metasomal terga 
(including laterally on T6) and S4 (Fig. 24), and by the hairs on the apical margin of 
S4 that are longer medially than laterally. Osmia calaminthae can be separated from 
O. cordata by the deep and large punctures on the frons and vertex. Males of O. sandhouseae 
Mitchell are superficially similar; however, in that species the punctures on the 
upper gena are extremely large and deep, much more so than on the vertex, while in O. 
calaminthae the punctures of the upper gena and vertex are subequal in size.<P>Description. Female. Figs 5–7, 9–16. Total length: ca. 11 mm (10–11 mm); Forewing 
length: 7 mm (6–7 mm); distance between lateral ocellus and preoccipital margin 
0.6 mm (0.5–0.6 mm); distance of lateral ocellus to compound eye 0.6 mm.<P>Color: Dark blue (mesosoma sometimes with integument slightly paler blue), except 
with brown integument on mouthparts, labrum, mandible, apical edge of clypeus, 
antenna, legs distal to trochanters, apical margins of metasomal terga, and metasomal 
sterna. Wings strongly infuscate.<P> Pubescence: Hairs entirely white to pale golden except darker golden on mouthparts 
and distally on legs, brown on wings; hairs conspicuous on mesosoma and T1 so as to obscure underlying blue integument, but inconspicuous on distal terga. Galea 
and basal two labial palpal segments with hairs on lateral margins straight, 0.2–0.5 
OD in length. Labrum with long hairs arranged in two curved, transverse rows, along 
subapical margin and at approximate midpoint (hairs slightly more scattered along 
row at midpoint), with additional fringe of shorter hairs at apical margin. Clypeus 
below apical margin with lateral tuft of pale golden, medially directed hairs (often hidden 
by clypeal margin). Head with short, stout, simple, erect hairs evenly spaced on 
face (Figs 5, 6), scape, and pedicel, these hairs denser and appressed on outer surface 
of mandible, longer and relatively sparse on ventral margin of mandible, vertex, and 
posteriorly on gena. Hypostomal area with straight, minutely branched hairs evenly 
distributed across area, 2.0–3.0 OD in length. Mesosoma (excluding legs and wings) 
and laterally on T1 covered with dense, long, minutely branched, white hairs (Figs 9, 
10); remainder of metasomal terga with hairs conspicuously shorter and sparser than 
hairs on mesosoma and T1. Legs with hairs on outer surfaces white, on forefemur and 
foretibia relatively slender and minutely branched, on foretarsal segments long (ca. 
3.0 OD in length), slightly stouter, and simple; on midleg outer surface entirely minutely 
branched; on hindleg outer surface mostly minutely branched except basitarsus 
with hairs appressed, simple, and relatively stout. Legs with hairs on inner surfaces of 
fore- and midfemora and fore- and midtibiae white, minutely branched, and relatively
