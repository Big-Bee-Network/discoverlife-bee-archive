<b>Overview</b></td></tr><tr><td>
Within the Scutellinitens group, A. robervalensis may be distinguished from A. scutellinitens by the clypeus less protuberant, and from A. specularia by the scutellum tessellate and dull. A. robervalensis has much more black hair than the other two species and the wings are more clouded apically. In size, disposition, and coloration of vestiture, A. robervalensis is much like A. peckhami, but is widely separated from that species by the inner margin of the compound eye diverging slightly above except for upper end incurved, and the males without a strong genal ridge. 
<br><br> 
<br>Female. Measurements and ratios. — N = 20; length, 8.5-11.2 mm; width, 2.6-3.6 mm; wing length, M=3.00± 0.192 mm; FL/FW, M = 1.01 ± 0.131; FOVL/FOVW, M = 3.17 ±0.158. 
<br><br> 
Integumental Color. — Black except as follows: antennae with flagellar segments ventrally becoming brown apically; mandible with apical half red; tibial spurs nearly white; tarsal claws with basal half yellow, apical half red; tegula and pterostigma medium brown; wing veins yellow brown; wing membrane hyaline except for apical area moderately darkened; metasomal terga and sterna with moderately wide hyaline apical area; pygidial plate red.

Clypeus moderately protuberant, extending below level of eyes for one-third its length, with large punctures medially separated by 2 diameters, puncture size decreasing dorsolaterally, shagreened throughout but shagreening weak medioventrally. Supraclypeal area densely shagreened with large punctures between antennal fossae. Genal area one-third wider than eye, with reticular shagreening and small punctures separated by 4 diameters throughout, except shagreening weak near eye. Vertex above lateral ocellus slightly wider than 1 ocellar diameter, moderately tessellate, with medium-sized, deep punctures separated by 1 diameter. Supra-antennal area longitudinally rugulate. Facial fovea of equal width throughout, rounded above and below, reaching above to a line through middle of lateral ocellus, below to a line nearly half way between lower margin of antennal fossa and upper margin of clypeus.

Scutum with medium-sized, scattered punctures, punctures tessellate internally. Scutellum with tessellation weak anteriorly, nearly shiny. Metanotum with large punctures, closely grouped in lateral thirds. Propodeal enclosure with broad anterior band of irregular, longitudinal rugulae and shallow, longitudinal, median depression. Dorsoposterior surfaces with medium-sized punctures separated by 2 diameters. Propodeal corbicular area with reticular shagreening and scattered punctures in anterior fourth. Mesepisternum moderately tessellate with medium-sized punctures throughout separated by 2 to 3 diameters. Metepisternum with weak, reticular shagreening, lower half nearly shiny. Mesobasitarsus widest medially, 3 times longer than wide, equal in width to metabasitarsus. Metabasitarsus widest basally, 3.5 times longer than wide, five-sixths as wide as metatibia. Metatibia widest apically, 3.3 times longer than wide. Pterostigma 4 times longer than wide, vein 1st m-cu meets second submarginal cell one-fourth of distance from apex.

<br><br> 
Integumental Color. — Black except as follows: antenna less colored ventrally beyond second flagellar segment; mandible with apical third red; tibial spurs nearly white; distitarsi red-brown; tarsal claws with basal half yellow, apical half red; tegula, wing veins and pterostigma dark brown; wing membrane hyaline except for broad, apical area moderately darkened. 
Metasomal terga and sterna with moderately wide apical margin hyaline. 
<br><br> 
Structure. — Scape slightly longer than pedicel plus flagellar segments 1 plus 2, about equal to flagellar segments 1 plus 2 plus half of flagellar segment 3; flagellar segment 1 longer than flagellar segment 3. Eye 3.3 times longer than wide, with inner margin diverging slightly above except for extreme upper limit incurved. Malar space, mandible, and galea as in female. Maxillary palpus with half of apical segment projecting beyond apex of galea; segmental ratio 0.6:0.9:0.7:0.8:0.8:0.8. Labial palpus with basal segment flattened, curved laterally, apical segment attached subapically, segmental ratio 1.1:0.5:0.5:0.7. Labral process strongly recurved, twice as wide as long, apical emargination depth one-third length of reflexed area. Clypeus nearly flat, extending below eyes for less than one-half its length, with small, medioventral, depressed, impunctate area; remainder with large punctures separated by one-half diameter, very narrow upper peripheral area with very light shagreening, surface shiny. Supraclypeal area as in female. Genal area more than 1.5 times wider than eye, produced posteriorly opposite midpoint of eye to a blunt projection, sculptured as in female. Vertex above lateral ocellus 1.3 times diameter of ocellus, sculptured as in female. Supra-antennal area as in female. Parocular area above base of antenna sculptured as for supra-antennal area, below antenna punctured as for clypeus. 
Pronotum with humeral angle and ridge well developed, almost carinate, pronotal suture very weak, humeral ridge not depressed where reached by pronotal suture, area above pronotal suture with weak, vertical rugulae, remainder of pronotum with reticular shagreening, reticular shagreening weak below pronotal suture, this area shiny. Remainder of mesosoma sculptured as in female except lateral propodeal area weakly tessellate. 
Metasomal terga 1 to 5 sculptured as in female metasomal terga 1 to 4 except tessellation very weak, surface shinier. Sterna much as in female, shinier. Sternum 7 (fig. 53) with basal apodemes narrowing anteriorly; with a broad, V-shaped emargination apically, processes on each side of emargination pointed with long hairs. Sternum 8 (fig. 54) with apex and neck region almost twice as long as basal region, apex pointed; neck area with abundant, long hair. Gonoforceps (figs. 50 to 52) in dorsal and lateral view strongly ridged. Penis valves in dorsal and ventral view strongly expanded basally, narrowing gradually apically, except apex rounded, lobe-like; in lateral view strongly bent downwards below gonoforceps. 
<br><br> 
Vestiture. — White except as below: clypeus with long, abundant pubescence. Terga 1 to 5 with weakly formed, apical fasciae, width one-third width of terga. Tergum 1 with long, erect hairs on disc, tergum 2 with shorter hairs on disc, some of these hairs black-brown. Terga 2 to 5 with shorter, sparse, black hairs on discs, posteriorly directed. Sterna 2 to 6 with long hairs projecting posteriorly. 
<br><br> 
Variation. — In females the proportion of white to black or nearly black hairs may vary. In most females the two long tufts of hairs projecting from the clypeus are brown. The hairs lying laterally over the facial foveae are mostly black or nearly black. The scutum may have mostly white or mostly black hairs. The small impunctate area may be nearly absent. The holotype female has only 2 submarginal cells in each wing, and metasomal tergum 1 is without a fascia, but this lack of a fascia is probably a result of wear.
